## Attention Mechanisms

### Self-Attention Fundamentals

The attention mechanism is the core innovation that makes transformers powerful. It allows models to focus on different parts of the input sequence when processing each element.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Query, Key, Value (QKV) Framework**: How attention computes relationships between elements
- **Scaled Dot-Product Attention**: The mathematical formulation of attention
- **Multi-Head Attention**: Parallel attention mechanisms for different representation subspaces
- **Attention Weights**: Understanding how attention scores are computed and used

**Mathematical Foundation:**
```math
\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V
```

Where:
- $`Q`$: Query matrix
- $`K`$: Key matrix  
- $`V`$: Value matrix
- $`d_k`$: Dimension of keys (scaling factor)

### Positional Encoding

Since transformers process sequences in parallel, they need explicit positional information to understand sequence order.

**Topics Covered:**
- **Sinusoidal Positional Encoding**: The original transformer positional encoding
- **Learned Positional Embeddings**: Alternative approaches to position representation
- **Relative Positional Encoding**: Position-aware attention mechanisms
- **RoPE (Rotary Position Embedding)**: Modern positional encoding techniques

## Transformer Architecture

### Encoder-Decoder Structure

The original transformer uses an encoder-decoder architecture, while modern variants often use encoder-only or decoder-only structures.

**Encoder Components:**
- **Multi-Head Self-Attention**: Captures relationships within the input sequence
- **Feed-Forward Networks**: Position-wise transformations
- **Layer Normalization**: Stabilizes training
- **Residual Connections**: Helps with gradient flow

**Decoder Components:**
- **Masked Self-Attention**: Prevents looking at future tokens during training
- **Cross-Attention**: Attends to encoder outputs
- **Autoregressive Generation**: Sequential token generation

### Architectural Variants

**Modern Transformer Variants:**
- **BERT**: Bidirectional encoder for understanding
- **GPT**: Autoregressive decoder for generation
- **T5**: Text-to-text transfer transformer
- **RoBERTa**: Robustly optimized BERT
- **DeBERTa**: Decoding-enhanced BERT with disentangled attention

## Large Language Models
