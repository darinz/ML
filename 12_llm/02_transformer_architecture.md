# Transformer Architecture

## Overview

The Transformer architecture, introduced in "Attention Is All You Need," revolutionized natural language processing by replacing recurrent and convolutional components with attention mechanisms. This guide provides a deep dive into the transformer's architectural components, variants, and implementation details.

## From Attention Mechanisms to Complete Architectures

We've now explored **attention mechanisms** - the foundational innovation that powers modern transformer architectures and large language models. We've seen how the query-key-value framework enables parallel processing of sequences, how multi-head attention captures different types of relationships simultaneously, and how positional encoding maintains sequence order information.

However, while attention mechanisms provide the core computational unit, **real-world language models** require complete architectures that combine attention with other essential components. Consider a machine translation system - it needs not just attention, but also encoders to understand the source language, decoders to generate the target language, and mechanisms to coordinate between them.

This motivates our exploration of **transformer architecture** - the complete framework that combines attention mechanisms with encoder-decoder structures, feed-forward networks, layer normalization, and residual connections. We'll see how the original transformer architecture was designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks, how modern variants like BERT and GPT serve different purposes, and how these architectures enable the powerful language models that have revolutionized AI.

The transition from attention mechanisms to transformer architecture represents the bridge from core components to complete systems - taking our understanding of how attention works and building it into full architectures that can understand, generate, and manipulate language.

In this section, we'll explore transformer architecture, understanding how attention mechanisms are integrated into complete models for various language tasks.

## Introduction to Transformers

### What is a Transformer?

A transformer is a neural network architecture that uses attention mechanisms to process sequential data. Unlike RNNs and CNNs, transformers can process entire sequences in parallel, making them highly efficient for modern hardware.

### Key Innovations

**Revolutionary Features:**
- **Parallel Processing**: All positions processed simultaneously
- **Self-Attention**: Captures relationships between any positions
- **No Recurrence**: Eliminates sequential dependencies
- **Scalability**: Can handle long sequences effectively

### Why Transformers Work

**Advantages over Previous Architectures:**
- **Long-range Dependencies**: Can model relationships across entire sequences
- **Parallelization**: Training and inference can be parallelized
- **Interpretability**: Attention weights provide insights into model decisions
- **Flexibility**: Can be adapted for various sequence lengths and modalities

## Encoder-Decoder Architecture

### Original Transformer Structure

The original transformer uses an encoder-decoder architecture designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks like machine translation.

```math
\text{Transformer}(X, Y) = \text{Decoder}(\text{Encoder}(X), Y)
```

### Encoder Stack

The encoder processes the input sequence and creates a rich representation that captures relationships between all input elements.

**Encoder Architecture:**
```math
\text{Encoder}(X) = \text{LayerNorm}_N \circ \text{FFN}_N \circ \text{Attention}_N \circ \ldots \circ \text{LayerNorm}_1 \circ \text{FFN}_1 \circ \text{Attention}_1(X)
```

**Key Components:**
1. **Multi-Head Self-Attention**: Captures relationships within input
2. **Feed-Forward Network**: Position-wise transformations
3. **Layer Normalization**: Stabilizes training
4. **Residual Connections**: Helps with gradient flow

### Decoder Stack

The decoder generates the output sequence autoregressively, using both self-attention and cross-attention to encoder outputs.

**Decoder Architecture:**
```math
\text{Decoder}(X, Y) = \text{LayerNorm}_N \circ \text{FFN}_N \circ \text{CrossAttention}_N \circ \text{MaskedAttention}_N \circ \ldots \circ \text{LayerNorm}_1 \circ \text{FFN}_1 \circ \text{CrossAttention}_1 \circ \text{MaskedAttention}_1(Y, X)
```

**Key Components:**
1. **Masked Self-Attention**: Prevents looking at future tokens
2. **Cross-Attention**: Attends to encoder outputs
3. **Feed-Forward Network**: Position-wise transformations
4. **Layer Normalization**: Stabilizes training

## Core Components

### 1. Multi-Head Self-Attention

Self-attention allows each position to attend to all positions in the sequence, capturing complex relationships.

**Mathematical Formulation:**
```math
\text{MultiHead}(Q, K, V) = \text{Concat}(\text{head}_1, \ldots, \text{head}_h)W^O
```

Where each head computes:
```math
\text{head}_i = \text{Attention}(QW_i^Q, KW_i^K, VW_i^V)
```

**Implementation:**
The multi-head self-attention implementation is available in [`multi_head_attention.py`](multi_head_attention.py), which includes:

- `MultiHeadSelfAttention`: Specialized version for self-attention
- Proper tensor reshaping and concatenation
- Dropout and layer normalization
- Mask handling for causal attention

### 2. Feed-Forward Network

The feed-forward network applies position-wise transformations to each position independently.

**Mathematical Formulation:**
```math

```

**Implementation:**
The feed-forward network implementation is provided in [`feed_forward.py`](feed_forward.py), which includes:

### 3. Layer Normalization

Layer normalization stabilizes training by normalizing activations within each layer.

**Mathematical Formulation:**
```math
\text{LayerNorm}(x) = \gamma \odot \frac{x - \mu}{\sqrt{\sigma^2 + \epsilon}} + \beta
```

Where:
- $`\mu`$ and $`\sigma^2`$ are computed over the last dimension
- $`\gamma`$ and $`\beta`$ are learnable parameters
- $`\epsilon`$ is a small constant for numerical stability

### 4. Residual Connections

## From Architecture to Scale and Capability

We've now explored **transformer architecture** - the complete framework that combines attention mechanisms with encoder-decoder structures, feed-forward networks, layer normalization, and residual connections. We've seen how the original transformer architecture was designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks, how modern variants like BERT and GPT serve different purposes, and how these architectures enable powerful language models.

However, while transformer architecture provides the foundation, **the true power of modern AI** comes from scaling these architectures to unprecedented sizes. Consider GPT-3 with 175 billion parameters or GPT-4 with even more - these models demonstrate emergent capabilities that weren't explicitly programmed, including reasoning, code generation, and creative writing.

This motivates our exploration of **large language models (LLMs)** - the pinnacle of transformer-based architectures that demonstrate how scaling model size, data, and compute leads to emergent capabilities. We'll see how scaling laws guide optimal model and data sizes, how training techniques enable training of massive models, and how these models exhibit capabilities that emerge with scale rather than being explicitly designed.

The transition from transformer architecture to large language models represents the bridge from architectural foundations to scaled capabilities - taking our understanding of transformer components and applying it to the challenge of building models that can understand and generate human language at unprecedented levels.

In the next section, we'll explore large language models, understanding how scale leads to emergent capabilities and how to train and deploy these massive models.
