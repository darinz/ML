## Introduction to Attention

### What is Attention?

Attention is a mechanism that allows neural networks to focus on specific parts of the input when processing each element. Instead of treating all input elements equally, attention computes a weighted combination of input elements, where the weights are learned dynamically based on the content.

### Why Attention?

**Key Benefits:**
- **Parallelization**: Unlike RNNs, attention can process sequences in parallel
- **Long-range Dependencies**: Can capture relationships between distant elements
- **Interpretability**: Attention weights provide insights into model decisions
- **Flexibility**: Can be applied to various sequence lengths and modalities

### The Intuition

Think of attention like a spotlight that can focus on different parts of a stage (input sequence) depending on what's currently being performed (current element being processed). The spotlight's intensity (attention weight) determines how much focus each part receives.

## Mathematical Foundations

### Query-Key-Value Framework

The attention mechanism operates on three fundamental components:

- **Query (Q)**: What we're looking for
- **Key (K)**: What each input element offers
- **Value (V)**: The actual content of each input element

### Scaled Dot-Product Attention

The core attention formula is:

```math
\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V
```

**Step-by-step breakdown:**

1. **Compute Attention Scores**: $`QK^T`$
   - Measures similarity between queries and keys
   - Higher scores indicate stronger relationships

2. **Scale the Scores**: $`\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}`$
   - Prevents softmax from entering regions with small gradients
   - $`d_k`$ is the dimension of keys

3. **Apply Softmax**: $`\text{softmax}(\cdot)`$
   - Converts scores to probabilities (attention weights)
   - Ensures weights sum to 1

4. **Weighted Sum**: $`(\text{weights}) \times V`$
   - Combines values according to attention weights

### Detailed Mathematical Formulation

For a sequence of length $`n`$ and embedding dimension $`d`$:

```math
\begin{align}
Q &= XW_Q \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d_k} \\
K &= XW_K \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d_k} \\
V &= XW_V \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d_v} \\
\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) &= \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V
\end{align}
```

Where:
- $`X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}`$ is the input sequence
- $`W_Q, W_K, W_V`$ are learned weight matrices
- $`d_k`$ and $`d_v`$ are the dimensions of keys and values respectively

## Types of Attention

### 1. Self-Attention

Self-attention computes attention within the same sequence, allowing each position to attend to all positions in the sequence.

**Use Cases:**
- Understanding relationships within a single sequence
- Capturing long-range dependencies
- Learning contextual representations

**Example:**
```python
# Self-attention in a sentence
sentence = "The cat sat on the mat"
# Each word attends to all other words to understand context
```

### 2. Cross-Attention

Cross-attention computes attention between two different sequences, typically used in encoder-decoder architectures.

**Use Cases:**
- Machine translation (encoder output → decoder)
- Question answering (question → context)
- Summarization (source → target)

**Example:**
```python
# Cross-attention in translation
source = "Hello world"
target = "Hola mundo"
# Target words attend to source words for translation
```

### 3. Masked Attention

Masked attention prevents the model from looking at future tokens, essential for autoregressive generation.

**Use Cases:**
- Language modeling
- Text generation
- Causal modeling

**Implementation:**
```python
# Create causal mask
mask = torch.triu(torch.ones(seq_len, seq_len), diagonal=1)
attention_scores = attention_scores.masked_fill(mask == 1, float('-inf'))
```

## Multi-Head Attention

### Motivation

Single attention can only focus on one type of relationship at a time. Multi-head attention allows the model to attend to different types of relationships simultaneously.

### Mathematical Formulation

```math
\text{MultiHead}(Q, K, V) = \text{Concat}(\text{head}_1, \text{head}_2, \ldots, \text{head}_h)W^O
```

Where each head is:
```math
\text{head}_i = \text{Attention}(QW_i^Q, KW_i^K, VW_i^V)
```

### Implementation Structure

The complete implementation of multi-head attention can be found in [`code/multi_head_attention.py`](code/multi_head_attention.py), which includes:

- `MultiHeadAttention`: Standard multi-head attention for general use
- `MultiHeadSelfAttention`: Specialized version for self-attention
- Proper tensor reshaping and concatenation
- Dropout and layer normalization

## Positional Encoding

### The Problem

Since attention processes all positions in parallel, it has no inherent notion of sequence order. Positional encoding provides this crucial information.

### Sinusoidal Positional Encoding

The original transformer uses sinusoidal positional encoding:

```math
PE_{(pos, 2i)} = \sin\left(\frac{pos}{10000^{2i/d_{model}}}\right)
```

```math
PE_{(pos, 2i+1)} = \cos\left(\frac{pos}{10000^{2i/d_{model}}}\right)
```

**Properties:**
- **Uniqueness**: Each position has a unique encoding
- **Extrapolation**: Can handle sequences longer than training
- **Relative Positions**: Encodes relative position information

### Implementation

The positional encoding implementation is available in [`code/positional_encoding.py`](code/positional_encoding.py), which includes:

- `PositionalEncoding`: Sinusoidal positional encoding
- `LearnedPositionalEmbedding`: Learned positional embeddings as an alternative
- Proper initialization and forward pass methods

### Alternative Positional Encodings

**1. Learned Positional Embeddings**
- Encodes relative distances between positions
- More efficient for long sequences

**2. Relative Positional Encoding**
- Encodes relative distances between positions
- More efficient for long sequences

**3. RoPE (Rotary Position Embedding)**
- Applies rotation matrices to embeddings
- Better extrapolation to longer sequences

## From Attention Mechanisms to Complete Architectures

We've now explored **attention mechanisms** - the foundational innovation that powers modern transformer architectures and large language models. We've seen how the query-key-value framework enables parallel processing of sequences, how multi-head attention captures different types of relationships simultaneously, and how positional encoding maintains sequence order information.

However, while attention mechanisms provide the core computational unit, **real-world language models** require complete architectures that combine attention with other essential components. Consider a machine translation system - it needs not just attention, but also encoders to understand the source language, decoders to generate the target language, and mechanisms to coordinate between them.

This motivates our exploration of **transformer architecture** - the complete framework that combines attention mechanisms with encoder-decoder structures, feed-forward networks, layer normalization, and residual connections. We'll see how the original transformer architecture was designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks, how modern variants like BERT and GPT serve different purposes, and how these architectures enable the powerful language models that have revolutionized AI.

The transition from attention mechanisms to transformer architecture represents the bridge from core components to complete systems - taking our understanding of how attention works and building it into full architectures that can understand, generate, and manipulate language.

In the next section, we'll explore transformer architecture, understanding how attention mechanisms are integrated into complete models for various language tasks.
