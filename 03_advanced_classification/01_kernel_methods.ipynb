    "# Kernel Methods: A Comprehensive Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Kernel methods represent one of the most powerful and elegant ideas in\n",
    "machine learning. They allow us to work in high-dimensional feature\n",
    "spaces without ever explicitly computing the features, enabling us to\n",
    "capture complex non-linear patterns in data efficiently. This guide will\n",
    "take you from the fundamental motivation behind kernels to their\n",
    "practical implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Kernels Matter:** - **Non-linearity**: Capture complex patterns\n",
    "that linear models cannot - **Efficiency**: Work in infinite-dimensional\n",
    "spaces with finite computation - **Flexibility**: Apply to any algorithm\n",
    "that can be expressed in terms of inner products - **Theoretical\n",
    "Foundation**: Based on solid mathematical principles from functional\n",
    "analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5.1 Feature Maps and the Motivation for Kernels\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.1.1 The Linear Model Limitation\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Problem with Linearity**\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that in our discussion about linear regression, we considered the\n",
    "problem of predicting the price of a house (denoted by $y$) from the\n",
    "living area of the house (denoted by $x$), and we fit a linear function\n",
    "of $x$ to the training data. What if the price $y$ can be more\n",
    "accurately represented as a *non-linear* function of $x$? In this case,\n",
    "we need a more expressive family of models than linear models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intuitive Example: Housing Price Prediction**\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a dataset where house prices follow a non-linear pattern: -\n",
    "**Small houses (500-1000 sq ft)**: Price increases slowly (economies of\n",
    "scale) - **Medium houses (1000-2000 sq ft)**: Price increases rapidly\n",
    "(sweet spot for families) - **Large houses (2000+ sq ft)**: Price\n",
    "increases slowly again (diminishing returns)\n",
    "\n",
    "A linear model $y = \\theta_1 x + \\theta_0$ would fail to capture this\n",
    "pattern, leading to poor predictions. The relationship is inherently\n",
    "non-linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Intuition:** The linear model assumes that the rate of\n",
    "change (derivative) is constant: $\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\theta_1$. But in\n",
    "reality, the rate of change varies with $x$, suggesting we need a more\n",
    "complex model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.1.2 Polynomial Feature Maps: A Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Polynomial Approach**\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by considering fitting cubic functions\n",
    "$y = \\theta_3 x^3 + \\theta_2 x^2 + \\theta_1 x + \\theta_0$. This allows\n",
    "us to capture non-linear patterns. It turns out that we can view the\n",
    "cubic function as a linear function over a different set of feature\n",
    "variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Feature Map Transformation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Concretely, let the function $\\phi : \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}^4$ be\n",
    "defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\phi(x) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ x \\\\ x^2 \\\\ x^3 \\end{bmatrix} \\in \\mathbb{R}^4.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $\\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}^4$ be the vector containing\n",
    "$\\theta_0, \\theta_1, \\theta_2, \\theta_3$ as entries. Then we can rewrite\n",
    "the cubic function in $x$ as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\theta_3 x^3 + \\theta_2 x^2 + \\theta_1 x + \\theta_0 = \\theta^T \\phi(x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insight**: A cubic function of the variable $x$ can be viewed as a\n",
    "linear function over the variables $\\phi(x)$. This is the fundamental\n",
    "idea behind feature maps.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Works:** - We’ve transformed a non-linear problem in the\n",
    "original space into a linear problem in a higher-dimensional space - The\n",
    "feature map $\\phi$ captures the non-linear structure - We can now use\n",
    "linear learning algorithms in the feature space\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.1.3 Terminology and Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Distinguishing Concepts**\n",
    "\n",
    "To distinguish between these two sets of variables, in the context of\n",
    "kernel methods, we will call the “original” input value the input\n",
    "**attributes** of a problem (in this case, $x$, the living area). When\n",
    "the original input is mapped to some new set of quantities $\\phi(x)$, we\n",
    "will call those new quantities the **features** variables. We will call\n",
    "$\\phi$ a **feature map**, which maps the attributes to the features.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formal Definition**: A feature map is a function\n",
    "$\\phi : \\mathcal{X} \\to \\mathcal{H}$ where: - $\\mathcal{X}$ is the input\n",
    "space (e.g., $\\mathbb{R}^d$) - $\\mathcal{H}$ is the feature space (e.g.,\n",
    "$\\mathbb{R}^p$ where $p \\geq d$)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intuition Behind the Names:** - **Attributes**: Raw, observable\n",
    "characteristics of the data - **Features**: Transformed representations\n",
    "that capture patterns - **Feature Map**: The transformation that reveals\n",
    "the hidden structure\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.1.4 Examples of Feature Maps\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Polynomial Feature Maps\n",
    "\n",
    "**General Form**: For degree $k$ polynomials in $d$ dimensions:\n",
    "$$\\phi(x) = [1, x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_d, x_1^2, x_1x_2, \\ldots, x_d^k]^T$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: For $d=2$ and $k=2$:\n",
    "$$\\phi(x_1, x_2) = [1, x_1, x_2, x_1^2, x_1x_2, x_2^2]^T$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Polynomials?** - They can approximate any smooth function (Taylor\n",
    "series) - They capture interactions between variables - They’re\n",
    "computationally tractable for low degrees\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Radial Basis Function (RBF) Feature Maps\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**:\n",
    "$$\\phi(x) = [\\exp(-\\gamma\\|x - c_1\\|^2), \\exp(-\\gamma\\|x - c_2\\|^2), \\ldots]^T$$\n",
    "where $c_i$ are centers and $\\gamma$ is a parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intuition**: Each feature measures the similarity to a reference point\n",
    "$c_i$. Points close to $c_i$ have high values, points far away have low\n",
    "values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Properties**: - **Local**: Each feature is sensitive to a specific\n",
    "region - **Smooth**: The exponential function provides smooth\n",
    "transitions - **Flexible**: Can capture complex non-linear patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Trigonometric Feature Maps\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**:\n",
    "$$\\phi(x) = [1, \\sin(x), \\cos(x), \\sin(2x), \\cos(2x), \\ldots]^T$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Case**: Periodic patterns, signal processing, time series\n",
    "analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fourier Series Connection**: This is related to Fourier series\n",
    "expansion, where any periodic function can be expressed as a sum of\n",
    "sines and cosines.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.1.5 The Curse of Dimensionality\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "As we increase the degree of polynomial features or the dimensionality\n",
    "of the input, the feature space grows exponentially:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Degree 2 polynomial in $d$ dimensions**: $O(d^2)$ features\n",
    "- **Degree 3 polynomial in $d$ dimensions**: $O(d^3)$ features  \n",
    "- **Degree $k$ polynomial in $d$ dimensions**: $O(d^k)$ features\n",
    "\n",
    "**Concrete Example**: For $d=100$ and $k=3$: - Original space: 100\n",
    "dimensions - Feature space:\n",
    "$\\binom{100+3}{3} = \\binom{103}{3} = 176,851$ dimensions\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Computational Challenge**\n",
    "\n",
    "This exponential growth makes explicit computation of features\n",
    "computationally prohibitive for high-dimensional data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Memory**: Storing feature vectors becomes impossible\n",
    "2.  **Computation**: Computing inner products becomes expensive\n",
    "3.  **Storage**: The feature matrix grows quadratically with dataset\n",
    "    size\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Need for a Solution**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where the kernel trick comes in - it allows us to work\n",
    "implicitly in these high-dimensional spaces without ever computing the\n",
    "features explicitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5.2 LMS (Least Mean Squares) with Features\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.2.1 Review of Standard LMS\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Standard Problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "We will derive the gradient descent algorithm for fitting the model\n",
    "$\\theta^T \\phi(x)$. First recall that for ordinary least square problem\n",
    "where we were to fit $\\theta^T x$, the batch gradient descent update is:\n",

    "\n",
    "### 5.2.2 LMS with Feature Maps\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Extension**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $\\phi : \\mathbb{R}^d \\to \\mathbb{R}^p$ be a feature map that maps\n",
    "attribute $x$ (in $\\mathbb{R}^d$) to the features $\\phi(x)$ in\n",
    "$\\mathbb{R}^p$. Now our goal is to fit the function $\\theta^T \\phi(x)$,\n",
    "with $\\theta$ being a vector in $\\mathbb{R}^p$ instead of\n",
    "$\\mathbb{R}^d$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insight**: We can replace all the occurrences of $x^{(i)}$ in the\n",
    "algorithm above by $\\phi(x^{(i)})$ to obtain the new update:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\theta := \\theta + \\alpha \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left( y^{(i)} - \\theta^T \\phi(x^{(i)}) \\right) \\phi(x^{(i)}). \\tag{5.3}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stochastic Version**\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the corresponding stochastic gradient descent update rule is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\theta := \\theta + \\alpha \\left( y^{(i)} - \\theta^T \\phi(x^{(i)}) \\right) \\phi(x^{(i)}). \\tag{5.4}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intuition**: Each update step now works in the feature space, allowing\n",
    "us to learn non-linear patterns while using a linear learning algorithm.\n",

    "**The Problem Statement**\n",
    "\n",
    "The gradient descent update becomes computationally expensive when the\n",
    "features $\\phi(x)$ are high-dimensional. Consider the direct extension\n",
    "of the feature map to high-dimensional input $x$: suppose\n",
    "$x \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$, and let $\\phi(x)$ be the vector that contains all\n",
    "the monomials of $x$ with degree $\\leq 3$:\n",

    "\n",
    "**The Scale of the Problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "The dimension of the features $\\phi(x)$ is on the order of $d^3$. This\n",
    "is prohibitively expensive — when $d = 1000$, each update requires\n",
    "computing and storing a $1000^3 = 10^9$ dimensional vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Happens**: Each monomial\n",
    "$x_1^{a_1} x_2^{a_2} \\cdots x_d^{a_d}$ where $\\sum_{i=1}^d a_i \\leq 3$\n",
    "becomes a separate feature.\n",

    "### 5.3.2 The Representer Theorem\n",

    "At any time, $\\theta$ can be represented as a linear combination of the\n",
    "vectors $\\phi(x^{(1)}), \\ldots, \\phi(x^{(n)})$.\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\\theta = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\beta_i \\phi(x^{(i)}) \\tag{5.6}$$\n",

    "**Decision Tree for Kernel Selection**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Start with RBF Kernel** (default choice)\n",
    "    - Works well for most problems\n",

    "is positive semi-definite for any set of points.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters**: - Ensures that the kernel corresponds to an inner\n",
    "product in some feature space - Guarantees that optimization problems\n",

    "\n",
    "**Testing positive definiteness**: 1. Compute the kernel matrix $K$ 2.\n",

    "positive definite\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.5.2 Mercer’s Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mercer’s Theorem**: If $K$ is a positive definite kernel, then there\n",
