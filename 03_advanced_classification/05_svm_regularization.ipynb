    "# 6.7 Regularization and the Non-separable Case\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Motivation:**\n",
    "In real-world datasets, perfect linear separability is rare. Outliers, noise, or overlapping classes can make it impossible to find a hyperplane that separates the data without error. SVMs address this by introducing slack variables and regularization, allowing some points to be misclassified or to fall within the margin, while still maximizing the margin as much as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Real-World Challenge**:\n",
    "The derivation of the SVM as presented so far assumed that the data is linearly separable. While mapping data to a high dimensional feature space via $\\phi$ does generally increase the likelihood that the data is separable, we can't guarantee that it always will be so. Also, in some cases it is not clear that finding a separating hyperplane is exactly what we'd want to do, since that might be susceptible to outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## From Optimal Classification to Practical Regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "We've now derived the **optimal margin classifier** and seen how the dual formulation naturally leads to kernelization and reveals the elegant structure of support vectors. The dual form expresses everything in terms of inner products, enabling us to work in high-dimensional feature spaces efficiently through the kernel trick.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the optimal margin classifier we've developed assumes that the data is **linearly separable** - that there exists a hyperplane that can perfectly separate all training points. In real-world problems, this assumption is often violated due to noise, outliers, or inherently non-separable data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This motivates our exploration of **SVM regularization** - extending the optimal margin classifier to handle non-separable data through the introduction of **slack variables** and the **soft margin** formulation. This regularization approach allows us to trade off between margin size and classification error, making SVMs robust to noisy data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The transition from optimal margin classification to regularization represents the bridge from theoretical perfection to practical robustness - taking our elegant mathematical formulation and adapting it to handle the messy realities of real-world data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we'll explore how regularization makes SVMs practical for real-world problems and introduces the crucial hyperparameter $C$ that controls the trade-off between margin size and classification accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Outlier Problem**:\n",
    "For instance, the left figure below shows an optimal margin classifier, and when a single outlier is added in the upper-left region (right figure), it causes the decision boundary to make a dramatic swing, and the resulting classifier has a much smaller margin.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./img/smaller_margin.png\" width=\"700px\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Solution**: To make the algorithm work for non-linearly separable datasets as well as be less sensitive to outliers, we reformulate our optimization (using $\\ell_1$ **regularization**) as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\min_{w, x, b} \\quad \\frac{1}{2} \\|w\\|^2 + C \\sum_{i=1}^n \\xi_i\n",

    "**Intuition:**\n",
    "The slack variables $\\xi_i$ measure how much each point violates the margin. If $\\xi_i = 0$, the point is correctly classified and outside the margin. If $0 < \\xi_i < 1$, the point is inside the margin but on the correct side. If $\\xi_i > 1$, the point is misclassified. The regularization parameter $C$ controls the trade-off between maximizing the margin and minimizing the total slack (i.e., classification error).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Implementation details are provided in the accompanying Python examples file.*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding Slack Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Slack Variable Concept**:\n",
    "Thus, examples are now permitted to have (functional) margin less than 1, and if an example has functional margin $1 - \\xi_i$ (with $\\xi > 0$), we would pay a cost of the objective function being increased by $C \\xi_i$. The parameter $C$ controls the relative weighting between the twin goals of making the $\\|w\\|^2$ small (which we saw earlier makes the margin large) and of ensuring that most examples have functional margin at least 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Trade-off**:\n",
    "- **Large $C$**: High penalty for violations, small margin, few misclassifications\n",
    "- **Small $C$**: Low penalty for violations, large margin, more misclassifications\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "**Practical scenario:**\n",
    "Suppose you have a dataset of emails, and a few spam emails are mislabeled as non-spam. Without slack variables, a single mislabeled point could force the SVM to create a very poor decision boundary. With slack and regularization, the SVM can \"ignore\" these outliers to some extent, leading to a more robust classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Implementation details are provided in the accompanying Python examples file.*\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Lagrangian Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "As before, we can form the Lagrangian:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathcal{L}(w, b, \\xi, \\alpha, r) = \\frac{1}{2} w^T w + C \\sum_{i=1}^n \\xi_i - \\sum_{i=1}^n \\alpha_i \\left[ y^{(i)} (w^T x^{(i)} + b) - 1 + \\xi_i \\right] - \\sum_{i=1}^n r_i \\xi_i.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the $\\alpha_i$'s and $r_i$'s are our Lagrange multipliers (constrained to be $\\geq 0$). We won't go through the derivation of the dual again in detail, but after setting the derivatives with respect to $w$ and $b$ to zero as before, substituting them back in, and simplifying, we obtain the following dual form of the problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Implementation details are provided in the accompanying Python examples file.*\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "The only change from the separable case is the upper bound $C$ on the $\\alpha_i$'s. This means that no single point can become \"too influential\" in determining the decision boundary, which helps control the effect of outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Key Changes**:\n",
    "- **Upper bound**: $\\alpha_i \\leq C$ (was $\\alpha_i \\geq 0$ before)\n",
    "- **Interpretation**: Limits the influence of any single training point\n",
    "- **Effect**: Prevents overfitting to outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "As before, we also have that $w$ can be expressed in terms of the $\\alpha_i$'s as given in Equation (6.10), so that after solving the dual problem, we can continue to use Equation (6.15) to make our predictions. Note that, somewhat surprisingly, in adding $\\ell_1$ regularization, the only change to the dual problem is that what was previously a constraint that $0 \\leq \\alpha_i$ has now become $0 \\leq \\alpha_i \\leq C$. The calculation for $b^*$ also has to be modified (Equation 6.13 is no longer valid); we'll see the correct formula later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, the KKT dual-complementarity conditions (which in the next section will be useful for testing for the convergence of the SMO algorithm) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\alpha_i = 0 \\implies y^{(i)} (w^T x^{(i)} + b) \\geq 1 \\tag{6.16}\n",
    "$$\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "**Remark:**\n",
    "These KKT conditions are not just theoreticalâ€”they are used in practice to check for convergence in SVM solvers like SMO.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Understanding the KKT Conditions**:\n",

    "For large datasets, solving the dual SVM problem directly can be computationally expensive, as it involves optimizing over all $\\alpha_i$'s simultaneously. The SMO algorithm breaks this large problem into a series of much smaller problems, each involving only two variables at a time, making it highly scalable and efficient.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The SMO (sequential minimal optimization) algorithm, due to John Platt, gives an efficient way of solving the dual problem arising from the derivation of the SVM. Partly to motivate the SMO algorithm, and partly because it's interesting in its own right, let's first take another digression to talk about the coordinate ascent algorithm.\n",

    "Thus, in the innermost loop of this algorithm, we will hold all the variables except for some $\\alpha_i$ fixed, and reoptimize $W$ with respect to just the parameter $\\alpha_i$. In the version of this method presented here, the inner-loop reoptimizes the variables in order $\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\ldots, \\alpha_n, \\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\ldots$. (A more sophisticated version might choose other orderings; for instance, we may choose the next variable to update according to which one we expect to allow us to make the largest increase in $W(\\alpha)$.)\n",
