    "## Problem 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Scientists tell us that there is a 10% probability that a person will have the flu this winter. Meanwhile, the CDC reports that 30% of the population will experience flu-like symptoms and that 60% of people with the flu will be symptomatic. What's the probability that Sarah has the flu given that she has flu-like symptoms?\n",
    "\n",
    "(A) 60%\n",
    "\n",
    "(B) 20%\n",
    "\n",
    "(C) 30%\n",
    "\n",
    "(D) 10%\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** The solution is (B).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a classic Bayes' theorem problem. Let's define the events:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **F** = \"person has the flu\" (P(F) = 0.10)\n",
    "- **S** = \"person has flu-like symptoms\" (P(S) = 0.30)  \n",
    "- **P(S|F)** = 0.60 (60% of people with flu are symptomatic)\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to find **P(F|S)**, the probability Sarah has the flu given she has symptoms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Using Bayes' theorem:**\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(F|S) = \\frac{P(S|F) \\times P(F)}{P(S)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(F|S) = \\frac{0.60 \\times 0.10}{0.30} = \\frac{0.06}{0.30} = 0.20 = 20\\%$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intuition:** Even though 60% of flu cases show symptoms, only 10% of people have the flu, while 30% of people show symptoms. So among symptomatic people, only 20% actually have the flu.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem 2\n",
    "\n",
    "True/False: The variance of a model typically decreases as the number of features increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "(A) True\n",
    "\n",
    "(B) False\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** The solution is (B).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This statement is **false**. In fact, the variance of a model typically **increases** as the number of features increases. This is known as the **\"curse of dimensionality\"** and is a fundamental concept in machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Here's why:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. More parameters to estimate**\n",
    "With more features, we have more parameters to estimate from the same amount of data, leading to higher estimation variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Sparse data**\n",
    "In high-dimensional spaces, data becomes sparse, making it harder to find reliable patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Overfitting risk**\n",
    "More features increase the risk of overfitting, which manifests as high variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practical implications:** This is why regularization techniques (like L1/L2 regularization) and dimensionality reduction methods (like PCA) are so important in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume you're given two independent random variables X and Y. X is uniformly distributed on the interval [1, 3], whereas Y follows a normal distribution with mean 3 and standard deviation 1. What is $(E[XY])^2 – E[X]E[Y]$?\n",
    "\n",
    "(A) 3\n",
    "\n",
    "(B) 30\n",
    "\n",
    "(C) 6\n",
    "\n",
    "(D) 0\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** The solution is (B).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "For independent random variables **X** and **Y**, we have **E[XY] = E[X]E[Y]**. Let's calculate each component:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **X ~ Uniform[1,3]**: $E[X] = \\frac{1+3}{2} = 2$\n",
    "- **Y ~ N(3,1)**: $E[Y] = 3$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since X and Y are independent: $E[XY] = E[X]E[Y] = 2 \\times 3 = 6$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we need to calculate: $(E[XY])^2 - E[X]E[Y] = 6^2 - 6 = 36 - 6 = 30$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key insight:** For independent random variables, $E[XY] = E[X]E[Y]$, but $(E[XY])^2 \\neq E[X]E[Y]$.\n",

    "## Problem 4\n",
    "\n",
    "True/False: If the columns of A are orthogonal, then $A^TA$ is diagonal.\n",
    "\n",
    "(A) True\n",
    "\n",
    "(B) False\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** The answer is (A).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is **true**. If the columns of matrix **A** are orthogonal, then **$A^T A$** is diagonal.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Here's why:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let **A = [a₁, a₂, ..., aₙ]** where each aᵢ is a column vector. Then:\n",
    "\n",
    "$A^T A$ = $[a₁^T; a₂^T; ...; aₙ^T] × [a₁, a₂, ..., aₙ]$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The **(i,j)** entry of $A^T$ A is **$aᵢ^T aⱼ$**. Since the columns are orthogonal:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **$aᵢ^T aⱼ = 0$** for i ≠ j (orthogonality)\n",
    "- **$aᵢ^T aᵢ = ||aᵢ||²$** for i = j (norm squared)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Therefore:** $A^T A$ is a diagonal matrix with diagonal entries **$||aᵢ||²$**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Extended Explanation**\n",
    "\n",
    "The statement in the problem is **true**: \"If the columns of $A$ are orthogonal, then $A^T A$ is diagonal.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### To break it down:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let matrix $A$ have columns $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$. So, we can write:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "A = \\begin{bmatrix} a_1 & a_2 & \\dots & a_n \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, when we compute $A^T A$, we are multiplying the **transpose** of $A$ by $A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The transpose $A^T$ turns the columns of $A$ into rows.\n",
    "* The multiplication $A^T A$ then combines these rows and columns to compute the dot products between each pair of columns of $A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's happening in the multiplication:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Matrix multiplication of $A^T$ and $A$:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   $A^T A$ results in a matrix where the **(i, j)** entry is the dot product of the **i-th column** of $A$ with the **j-th column** of $A$. Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   (A^T A)_{ij} = a_i^T a_j\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Orthogonality of the columns:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   If the columns of $A$ are **orthogonal**, this means:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * $a_i^T a_j = 0$ for $i \\neq j$, meaning that the dot product of any two distinct columns is zero.\n",
    "   * $a_i^T a_i = ||a_i||^2$, meaning the dot product of a column with itself is the square of its norm (its length).\n",
    "\n",
    "   This property of orthogonality means that **off-diagonal entries** of $A^T A$ (where $i \\neq j$) will be zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Diagonal nature of $A^T A$:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Since the off-diagonal entries are zero, the resulting matrix $A^T A$ will have non-zero entries only on the diagonal. These diagonal entries will be the squared norms of the columns of $A$, i.e., $||a_1||^2, ||a_2||^2, \\dots, ||a_n||^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If the columns of $A$ are orthogonal, $A^T A$ will be a diagonal matrix.\n",
    "* The diagonal entries will be the squared norms of the columns of $A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the statement is **true**, and the answer is **(A) True**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem 5\n",
    "\n",
    "True/False: Assume we train a model on a given dataset. If we were to remove 50% of samples from the dataset and re-train the model from scratch, the new model will be more likely to overfit to its training data than the old one.\n",
    "\n",
    "(A) True\n",
    "\n",
    "(B) False\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** The solution is (A).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is **true**. When we reduce the training dataset size by 50%, the model becomes more likely to overfit because:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Less data for learning**\n",
    "With fewer training examples, the model has less information to learn the true underlying patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Higher variance**\n",
    "Smaller datasets lead to higher variance in parameter estimates, making the model more sensitive to the specific training examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Reduced regularization effect**\n",
    "More training data naturally provides regularization by averaging out noise. With less data, this effect is diminished.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Easier to memorize**\n",
    "The model can more easily memorize the training data when there are fewer examples to remember.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practical implications:** This is why data augmentation and collecting more training data are common strategies to reduce overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem 6\n",
    "\n",
    "True/False: If $\\{v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_n\\}$ and $\\{w_1, w_2, \\dots, w_n\\}$ are linearly independent, then $\\{v_1 + w_1, v_2 + w_2, \\dots, v_n + w_n\\}$ are linearly independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "(A) True\n",
    "\n",
    "(B) False\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** The answer is (B).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is **false**. The sum of linearly independent sets is **not necessarily** linearly independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Counterexample:**\n",
    "Consider the vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^2$:\n",
    "- $v_1 = (1, 0)$, $v_2 = (0, 1)$ - linearly independent\n",
    "- $w_1 = (-1, 0)$, $w_2 = (0, -1)$ - linearly independent\n",
    "\n",
    "But $v_1 + w_1 = (0, 0)$ and $v_2 + w_2 = (0, 0)$, so the set $\\{v_1 + w_1, v_2 + w_2\\} = \\{(0, 0), (0, 0)\\}$ is **linearly dependent**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key insight:** Linear independence is **not preserved** under vector addition. The sum of independent sets can create dependent vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem 7\n",
    "\n",
    "True/False: $E[\\epsilon\\epsilon^T] = I$ where $\\epsilon_i \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2)$ such that $\\epsilon$ is a column vector: $\\epsilon \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$.\n",
    "\n",
    "(A) True\n",
    "\n",
    "(B) False\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** The answer is (B).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is **false**. The statement **E[εε^T] = I** is incorrect.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a random vector $\\varepsilon \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2I)$ where $\\varepsilon \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$, we have:\n",
    "$E[\\varepsilon\\varepsilon^T] = \\sigma^2I$, not $I$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Here's why:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **(i,j)** entry of $E[\\varepsilon\\varepsilon^T]$ is $E[\\varepsilon_i\\varepsilon_j]$. Since $\\varepsilon_i \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2)$ and the components are independent:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $E[\\varepsilon_i\\varepsilon_j] = 0$ for $i \\neq j$ (independence)\n",
    "- $E[\\varepsilon_i^2] = \\text{Var}(\\varepsilon_i) = \\sigma^2$ for $i = j$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Therefore:** $E[\\varepsilon\\varepsilon^T] = \\sigma^2I$, which equals $I$ only when $\\sigma^2 = 1$.\n",

    "Figure 1: The following graphic will be used as a representation of bias and variance.

    "Regularization **increases bias** and **decreases variance**. Here's why:\n",

    "\n",
    "Since we typically have n > 100 data points, LOOCV requires more model training iterations than 100-fold CV.\n",

    "1. **Nested hypothesis spaces**: The model with features S is a special case of the model with features S' (by setting the extra coefficients to zero)\n",
    "2. **Optimality**: The model with more features can always match or improve upon the performance of the simpler model\n",
    "3. **Monotonicity**: Adding features can only reduce (or keep the same) the bias, never increase it\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why feature engineering is important - more informative features generally lead to better model performance.\n",

    "## Problem 36\n",
    "\n",
    "True/False: The cross-validation error is a better estimate of the true error than the training error.\n",
    "\n",
    "(A) True\n",
    "\n",
    "(B) False\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** The solution is (A).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** This is true. Cross-validation error is a better estimate of the true error than training error because:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Unbiased estimate**: Cross-validation provides an unbiased estimate of how well the model will generalize to unseen data\n",
    "2. **Accounts for overfitting**: Training error is typically optimistic because the model has seen the training data, while CV error estimates performance on held-out data\n",
    "3. **More realistic**: CV error better reflects the actual performance we can expect in practice\n",
    "\n",
    "Training error tends to underestimate the true error, especially for complex models that may overfit the training data. Cross-validation gives us a more honest assessment of model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem 37\n",
    "\n",

    "(B) False\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** The solution is (B).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** This is false. The expected error of a model on unseen data is not equal to the training error, even when using leave-one-out cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's why:\n",
    "1. **Training error is optimistic**: The model has seen all the training data, so training error underestimates the true generalization error\n",
    "2. **LOOCV estimates generalization**: LOOCV provides an estimate of how well the model generalizes, but this is still an estimate, not the actual training error\n",
    "3. **Different quantities**: Training error measures performance on data the model has seen, while LOOCV error estimates performance on unseen data\n",
    "\n",
    "The LOOCV error is typically higher than the training error because it better reflects the model's true generalization performance.\n",
