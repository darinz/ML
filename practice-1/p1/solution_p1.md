# Practice 1 Solutions

## Problem 1

Scientists tell us that there is a 10% probability that a person will have the flu this winter. Meanwhile, the CDC reports that 30% of the population will experience flu-like symptoms and that 60% of people with the flu will be symptomatic. What's the probability that Sarah has the flu given that she has flu-like symptoms?

(A) 60%
(B) 20%
(C) 30%
(D) 10%

**Solution:** The solution is (B).

## Problem 2

True/False: The variance of a model typically decreases as the number of features increases.

(A) True
(B) False

**Solution:** The solution is (B).

## Problem 3

Assume you're given two independent random variables X and Y. X is uniformly distributed on the interval [1, 3], whereas Y follows a normal distribution with mean 3 and standard deviation 1. What is $(E[XY])^2 – E[X]E[Y]$?

(A) 3
(B) 30
(C) 6
(D) 0

**Solution:** The solution is (B).

## Problem 4

True/False: If the columns of A are orthogonal, then $A^TA$ is diagonal.

(A) True
(B) False

**Solution:** The answer is (A).

## Problem 5

True/False: Assume we train a model on a given dataset. If we were to remove 50% of samples from the dataset and re-train the model from scratch, the new model will be more likely to overfit to its training data than the old one.

(A) True
(B) False

**Solution:** The solution is (A).

## Problem 6

True/False: If $\{v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n\}$ and $\{w_1, w_2, \dots, w_n\}$ are linearly independent, then $\{v_1 + w_1, v_2 + w_2, \dots, v_n + w_n\}$ are linearly independent.

(A) True
(B) False

**Solution:** The answer is (B).

## Problem 7

True/False: $E[\epsilon\epsilon^T] = I$ where $\epsilon_i \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$ such that $\epsilon$ is a column vector: $\epsilon \in \mathbb{R}^d$.

(A) True
(B) False

**Solution:** The answer is (B).

Figure 1: The following graphic will be used as a representation of bias and variance. Imagine that a true/correct model is one that always predicts a location at the center of each target (being farther away from the center of the target indicates that a model’s predictions are worse). We retrain a model multiple times, and make a prediction with each trained model. For each of the targets, determine whether the bias and variance is low or high with respect to the true model.

## Problem 8

In Figure 1, subplot I, how are bias and variance related to the true model?

(A) High bias, High variance
(B) High bias, Low variance
(C) Low bias, High variance
(D) Low bias, Low variance

**Solution:** The solution is (D).

## Problem 9

In Figure 1, subplot II, how are bias and variance related to the true model?

(A) High bias, High variance
(B) High bias, Low variance
(C) Low bias, High variance
(D) Low bias, Low variance

**Solution:** The solution is (C).

## Problem 10

In Figure 1, subplot III, how are bias and variance related to the true model?

(A) High bias, High variance
(B) High bias, Low variance
(C) Low bias, High variance
(D) Low bias, Low variance

**Solution:** The solution is (B).

## Problem 11

In Figure 1, subplot IV, how are bias and variance related to the true model?
