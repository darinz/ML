    "In a popular gacha game, the probability of pulling an SSR character on a single pull is 0.6% (P = 0.006). Assume that each pull is independent and follows a Bernoulli distribution. In such games, players often perform a 10-pull, which means making 10 pulls. Each of these 10 pulls is still independent, meaning the probability of getting an SSR in each pull remains 0.006. If you perform a 10-pull, what is the probability of pulling exactly 2 SSRs? You do not need to know what gacha game is to solve this problem.\n",

    "**Correct answers:** (d)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** We model each pull as a Bernoulli trial, where the probability of success (pulling an SSR) is P = 0.006. Since a 10-pull consists of 10 independent trials, the number of SSRs obtained follows a Binomial distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "$X \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n = 10, p = 0.006)$\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to find the probability of pulling exactly 2 SSRs, which is given by the binomial probability mass function (PMF):\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(X = 2) = \\binom{10}{2} P^2 (1 - P)^8$\n",
    "\n",
    "Computing the combination: $\\binom{10}{2} = \\frac{10!}{2! \\times (10 - 2)!} = \\frac{10 \\times 9}{2} = 45$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the probability is: $P(X = 2) = (1 - P)^8 \\times P^2 \\times 45 = 0.15\\%$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the correct answer is D.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why other options are incorrect:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**A: 0** - This option would be correct if it were impossible to pull an SSR. However, since the probability of obtaining an SSR is nonzero, this option is incorrect.\n",
    "\n",
    "**B: $1 - (1 - P)^{10} = 5.84\\%$** - This formula calculates the probability of pulling at least 1 SSR, computed as: $P(\\text{at least 1 SSR}) = 1 - P(0 \\text{ SSRs}) = 1 - (1 - P)^{10}$. This probability includes cases where the player gets 1, 2, 3, ..., or even 10 SSRs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**C: $(1 - P)^9 \\times P \\times 10 = 5.68\\%$** - This formula calculates the probability of pulling exactly 1 SSR, given by: $P(X = 1) = \\binom{10}{1} P^1(1 - P)^9 = 10 \\times P \\times (1 - P)^9$. Hence, the correct answer remains D.\n",

    "Below are several statements about Gradient Descent (GD) and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). Which of the following are correct?\n",
    "\n",
    "*   (a) For GD, each step aims to move along the gradient descent direction at the current point to reduce the value of the objective function.\n",
    "*   (b) In SGD, each step computes an estimated gradient based on a single sample, introducing randomness, which may not guarantee that the objective function decreases in every step.\n",
    "*   (c) Suppose you have model $w_t$ at the $t$-th iteration of SGD. The expectation of the direction of the model update for SGD at step $t$ is different from the negative direction of the gradient $-\\nabla_w f(w)|_{w=w_t}$.\n",
    "*   (d) GD requires the full gradient information of the objective function, while SGD only needs the gradient information on a single sample at each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct answers:** (a), (b), (d)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** The correct answers are (A), (B), and (D). Below is an explanation of each option.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(A) Correct:** In Gradient Descent (GD), each step moves in the direction of the negative gradient of the objective function at the current point. This ensures that the function value decreases (assuming an appropriate step size). Mathematically, the update rule for GD is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$w_{t+1} = w_t - \\eta \\nabla_w f(w_t)$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\eta$ is the learning rate, and $\\nabla_w f(w_t)$ is the gradient of the objective function over the entire dataset at iteration $t$. This step guarantees movement in the direction that minimizes the objective function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(B) Correct:** In Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), instead of computing the exact gradient using the full dataset, an estimated gradient is computed based on a single sample (or a mini-batch). This introduces randomness in the updates, meaning that the objective function might not necessarily decrease in every step. The update rule for SGD can be rewritten as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$w_{t+1} = w_t - \\eta(\\nabla_w f(w_t) + \\xi_t)$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\nabla_w f(w_t)$ is the true full-batch gradient, and $\\xi_t$ is a noise term introduced due to the stochastic nature of SGD, representing the deviation from the full gradient when using only one sample. This noise term makes each individual update potentially non-optimal, but in expectation, the updates still align with the true gradient direction over multiple iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(C) Incorrect:** The expectation of the SGD update direction is equal to the negative full gradient:\n",
    "\n",
    "$E[\\nabla_w f(w_t) + \\xi_t] = \\nabla_w f(w_t)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since SGD approximates the full gradient using randomly sampled data points, its update direction is an unbiased estimate of the true gradient. That is, while each step introduces noise, on average, the update follows the same direction as GD. Therefore, the claim that the expectation is different from $-\\nabla_w f(w_t)$ is false.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(D) Correct:** GD requires the full gradient of the objective function, meaning it computes $\\nabla_w f(w)$ over the entire dataset at each step. In contrast, SGD only uses the gradient of a single sample (or a mini-batch), significantly reducing the computational cost per step, especially in large-scale datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the correct answers are (A), (B), and (D).\n",

    "In a gacha game, the probability of obtaining an SSR character per pull is $p$, but $p$ is unknown. To estimate $p$, Bob performed 100 pulls and obtained SSRs $k = 3$ times (i.e., 3 successes). Assume that each pull is independent and follows a Bernoulli distribution.\n",

    "\n",
    "MLE: $\\hat{p} = \\frac{3}{100}$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** Since each pull is independent and follows a Bernoulli distribution, the total number of SSRs obtained follows a Binomial distribution:\n",

    "$X \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n = 100, p)$\n",
    "\n",

    "Suppose you train a linear regression model (without doing feature expansion), i.e., $f_w(x) = wx + b$, to approximate the cubic function $g(x) = 2x^3 + 7x^2 + 4x + 3$. What's the most likely outcome?\n",

    "*   (d) The model will have high bias and high variance\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct answers:** (c)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** The model being linear means the variance is likely to be low. The linear model trying to approximate a cubic function, which is of a higher degree, means that the bias is likely to be high.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** You never want to use your Test Data for hyperparameter tuning, as it will bias the model on the test data. The test data should only be used for final evaluation of the model.

    "**Explanation:** By linearity of expectation, $E[A_1 + A_2 + A_3] = E[A_1] + E[A_2] + E[A_3]$. Since $A_1, A_2,..., A_n \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$, $E[A_1] = E[A_2] = E[A_3] = \\mu$. Thus, $E[A_1] + E[A_2] + E[A_3] = \\mu + \\mu + \\mu = 3\\mu$.\n",

    "Consider a function $f(x,y)$ representing a loss function in a 2-dimensional space, where gradient descent is used to minimize $f$. Given the function: $f(x, y) = x^2 + 2y^2 + 4xy$ where the initial point is $(x_0, y_0) = (1, 1)$ and the learning rate is 0.1, write down the $(x_1, y_1)$ you get after one step of gradient descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** $(x_1, y_1) = (0.4, 0.2)$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** From the gradient descent algorithm: $x_1 = x_0 - \\eta \\cdot \\frac{\\partial f(x_0, y_0)}{\\partial x}$ and $y_1 = y_0 - \\eta \\cdot \\frac{\\partial f(x_0, y_0)}{\\partial y}$. It is given that $\\eta = 0.1$. $\\frac{\\partial f(x,y)}{\\partial x} = 2x + 4y$. $\\frac{\\partial f(x,y)}{\\partial y} = 4y + 4x$. So, $x_1 = 1 - 0.1 \\cdot 6 = 0.4$ and $y_1 = 1 - 0.1 \\cdot 8 = 0.2$.\n",

    "Which of the following statements about ridge regression are true?\n",
    "\n",
    "*   (a) When there are correlated features, ridge regression typically sets the weights of all but one of the correlated features to 0.\n",
    "*   (b) Compared to unregularized linear regression, the additional computational cost of ridge regression increases proportional to the number of data points in the dataset.\n",
    "*   (c) Ridge regression reduces variance at the expense of increasing bias.\n",
    "*   (d) Using ridge and lasso regularization together (e.g., minimizing a training objective of the form $f(w) = \\sum_{i=1}^n (y^{(i)} - x^{(i)T}w)^2 + \\lambda_1||w||_1 + \\lambda_2||w||_2^2$) makes the training loss no longer convex.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct answers:** (c)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** Ridge regression typically shrinks the weights of correlated features about evenly. This means it probably won't set the weights of all but one of the correlated features to 0. That would be more akin to LASSO regression. The additional computational cost increases proportional to the number of weights in the dataset. Ridge-regression is an example of the bias-variance trade off. The sum of convex functions is convex so ridge and LASSO regression combined is still convex.\n",
