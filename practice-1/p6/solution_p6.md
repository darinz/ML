# Practice 6 Solutions

**Problem 1. In a machine learning classification problem, you have a dataset with two classes: Positive (P) and Negative (N). The probability of a randomly selected sample being Negative is 0.6. The probability of a correct classification given that the sample is Positive is 0.8, and the probability of a correct classification given that the sample is Negative is 0.6. What is the probability that a randomly selected sample is Positive given that it has been classified as Positive?**

*   (a) $\frac{4}{7}$
*   (b) $\frac{8}{17}$
*   (c) $\frac{4}{5}$
*   (d) $\frac{4}{15}$

**Correct answers:** (a)

**Explanation:**

**This is a Bayes' theorem problem** - finding the probability of being Positive given a Positive classification.

**Step-by-step solution:**

**1. Define events:**
- **P** = "Sample is Positive" 
- **N** = "Sample is Negative"
- **CP** = "Classified as Positive"
- **CN** = "Classified as Negative"

**2. Given information:**
- **$P(N) = 0.6$** (probability of being Negative)
- **$P(P) = 1 - P(N) = 0.4$** (probability of being Positive)
- **$P(CP|P) = 0.8$** (correct classification given Positive)
- **$P(CN|N) = 0.6$** (correct classification given Negative)

**3. Calculate additional probabilities:**
- **$P(CN|P) = 1 - P(CP|P) = 0.2$** (incorrect classification given Positive)
- **$P(CP|N) = 1 - P(CN|N) = 0.4$** (incorrect classification given Negative)

**4. Apply Bayes' theorem:**
$P(P|CP) = \frac{P(CP|P)P(P)}{P(CP)}$

**5. Calculate $P(CP)$ using law of total probability:**
$P(CP) = P(CP|P)P(P) + P(CP|N)P(N)$

$P(CP) = (0.8)(0.4) + (0.4)(0.6)$

$P(CP) = 0.32 + 0.24 = 0.56$

**6. Substitute into Bayes' theorem:**
$P(P|CP) = \frac{(0.8)(0.4)}{0.56} = \frac{0.32}{0.56} = \frac{32}{56} = \frac{4}{7}$

**7. Verification:**
- **Numerator:** $0.8 \times 0.4 = 0.32$ (true positives)
- **Denominator:** $0.56$ (all positive classifications)
- **Ratio:** $\frac{4}{7} \approx 0.57$ (about 57% of positive classifications are actually positive)

**Key insight:** **Low base rate** (40% positive) combined with **imperfect classification** means many false positives, leading to moderate precision.

**Problem 2. What is NOT true in the following statements?**

**The optimal weight $\hat{W}$ is given by the formula:**
$$\hat{W} = (X^T X + \lambda I)^{-1} X^T Y$$

**where:**
*   $X = [x_1 \cdots x_n]^T \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$
*   $Y = [y_1 \cdots y_n]^T \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times k}$

*   (a) When $\lambda > 0$, the matrix $X^T X + \lambda I$ is invertible.
*   (b) The identity $I$ is a $d \times d$ matrix.
*   (c) When $\lambda = 0$, the matrix is not full-rank, so there is no solution for Ridge Regression.
*   (d) If we apply a unitary transform $U \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$ ($U^T U = I$) on the input $X$ and output $Y$ to get another dataset $(UX, UY)$, the new estimated weight would still be $\hat{W}$.

**Correct answers:** (c)

**Explanation:**

**Option (c) is false** - Ridge regression can have solutions even when $\lambda = 0$ and the matrix is not full-rank.

**Why (c) is false:**

**1. Ridge regression with $\lambda = 0$:**
- **When $\lambda = 0$:** $\hat{W} = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T Y$
- **This reduces to ordinary least squares (OLS)**
- **OLS can have solutions** even with non-full-rank matrices

**2. Non-full-rank matrices and solutions:**
- **$X^T X$ can be singular** (not full-rank)
- **But solutions still exist** using Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse
- **Multiple solutions** may exist, but solutions exist nonetheless

**3. Why other options are true:**

**Option (a): $\lambda > 0$ ensures invertibility**
- **$X^T X$ is positive semi-definite**
- **Adding $\lambda I$ makes it positive definite** when $\lambda > 0$
- **Positive definite matrices are invertible**

**Option (b): Identity matrix dimensions**
- **$X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$**
- **$X^T \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times n}$**
- **$X^T X \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$**
- **$I$ must be $d \times d$** to match dimensions

**Option (d): Unitary transformation invariance**
- **Unitary transformations preserve inner products**
- **$(UX)^T(UX) = X^T U^T UX = X^T X$**
- **$(UX)^T(UY) = X^T U^T UY = X^T Y$**
- **Therefore:** $\hat{W}_{\text{new}} = \hat{W}$

**4. Mathematical verification:**
- **When $\lambda = 0$:** Ridge regression = OLS
- **OLS always has solutions** (may not be unique)
- **Pseudoinverse provides solutions** even for singular matrices

**Key insight:** **Ridge regression** with $\lambda = 0$ is **ordinary least squares**, which **always has solutions** regardless of matrix rank.

**The next two questions:**

A fresh graduate of CSE 446 is helping a biologist friend model the relationship between the concentration $y$ of amino acid Arginine in blood plasma and time $x$ in hours after interacting with a reagent. The experiment measured concentration within 3 distinct time blocks (A, B, C):

*   **A:** time $x = 0$ to around 6 hours (represented by circles)
*   **B:** time $x$ around 6 hours to $x$ around 12 hours (represented by squares)
*   **C:** time $x$ around 12 hours to $x$ around 16 hours (represented by the symbol 'x')

<img src="./experiment.png" width="350px">

**Problem 3. Based on the scatter plot above, which of the following statements is most likely to be true?**

*   (a) The relationship between $x$ and $y$ is linear across all time blocks.
*   (b) The relationship between $x$ and $y$ is non-linear and follows a piecewise pattern.
*   (c) There is no relationship between $x$ and $y$.
*   (d) The relationship between $x$ and $y$ is exponential.

**Correct answers:** (b)

**Explanation:**

**Option (b) is correct** - the data shows a clear piecewise pattern with different relationships in each time block.

**Why (b) is correct:**

**1. Visual analysis of the scatter plot:**
- **Block A (circles):** Shows a **positive linear trend** from 0-6 hours
- **Block B (squares):** Shows a **different slope** or **plateau** from 6-12 hours
- **Block C (x's):** Shows **another distinct pattern** from 12-16 hours

**2. Piecewise pattern characteristics:**
- **Different slopes** in each time block
- **Clear transitions** between blocks
- **Non-uniform relationship** across the entire time range
- **Biological interpretation:** Different reaction phases

**3. Why other options are incorrect:**

**Option (a): Linear across all blocks**
- **Single linear model** would not fit all three blocks well
- **Different slopes** indicate non-linear overall relationship
- **Piecewise linear** â‰  globally linear

**Option (c): No relationship**
- **Clear patterns** exist within each block
- **Systematic changes** in concentration over time
- **Strong evidence** of relationship

**Option (d): Exponential relationship**
- **Piecewise pattern** doesn't match exponential curve
- **Different phases** suggest complex, not simple exponential
- **Linear segments** within blocks contradict exponential

**4. Biological interpretation:**
- **Phase A:** Initial reaction phase (linear increase)
- **Phase B:** Saturation or equilibrium phase (plateau)
- **Phase C:** Decay or secondary reaction phase (different trend)

**Key insight:** **Piecewise patterns** are common in **biological systems** where different **reaction phases** occur over time.

**Problem 4. If you were to fit a linear regression model to this data, which of the following would be the most appropriate approach?**

*   (a) Fit a single linear model to all the data points.
*   (b) Fit separate linear models for each time block (A, B, C).
*   (c) Use polynomial regression with degree 2 or higher.
*   (d) Use logistic regression.

**Correct answers:** (b)

**Explanation:**

**Option (b) is correct** - fitting separate linear models for each time block captures the piecewise nature of the data.

**Why (b) is the most appropriate:**

**1. Captures piecewise structure:**
- **Three distinct phases** with different relationships
- **Separate models** can capture different slopes in each block
- **Better fit** than single global model

**2. Mathematical approach:**
- **Model A:** $y = w_A x + b_A$ for $0 \leq x \leq 6$
- **Model B:** $y = w_B x + b_B$ for $6 < x \leq 12$
- **Model C:** $y = w_C x + b_C$ for $12 < x \leq 16$

**3. Why other options are less appropriate:**

**Option (a): Single linear model**
- **Poor fit** due to piecewise nature
- **High bias** from forcing single slope
- **Misses important** phase-specific patterns

**Option (c): Polynomial regression**
- **Overfitting risk** with high-degree polynomials
- **Less interpretable** than piecewise linear
- **May not capture** the specific piecewise structure

**Option (d): Logistic regression**
- **Designed for classification**, not regression
- **Inappropriate** for continuous concentration values
- **Wrong problem type**

**4. Advantages of piecewise approach:**
- **Interpretable** - each phase has clear meaning
- **Flexible** - different models for different phases
- **Biological relevance** - matches expected reaction phases
- **Better predictions** within each phase

**5. Implementation considerations:**
- **Ensure continuity** at transition points if needed
- **Validate** each model separately
- **Consider uncertainty** at phase boundaries

**Key insight:** **Piecewise linear models** are ideal when data shows **distinct phases** with **different underlying relationships**.

**Problem 5. Consider a binary classification problem where you want to predict whether a customer will buy a product (class 1) or not (class 0). You have the following confusion matrix:**

|                | Predicted 0 | Predicted 1 |
|----------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Actual 0**   | 80          | 20          |
| **Actual 1**   | 10          | 90          |

**What is the precision of this classifier?**

*   (a) 0.75
*   (b) 0.80
*   (c) 0.82
*   (d) 0.90

**Correct answers:** (c)

**Explanation:**

**Precision is 0.82** - this measures the accuracy of positive predictions.

**Step-by-step calculation:**

**1. Precision formula:**
$\text{Precision} = \frac{\text{True Positives}}{\text{True Positives} + \text{False Positives}}$

**2. Extract values from confusion matrix:**
- **True Positives (TP):** 90 (Actual 1, Predicted 1)
- **False Positives (FP):** 20 (Actual 0, Predicted 1)
- **True Negatives (TN):** 80 (Actual 0, Predicted 0)
- **False Negatives (FN):** 10 (Actual 1, Predicted 0)

**3. Calculate precision:**
$\text{Precision} = \frac{90}{90 + 20} = \frac{90}{110} = \frac{9}{11} \approx 0.82$

**4. Interpretation:**
- **82% of positive predictions** are actually correct
- **18% of positive predictions** are false alarms
- **Good precision** indicates low false positive rate

**5. Why other options are incorrect:**
- **(a) 0.75:** Incorrect calculation
- **(b) 0.80:** Wrong fraction
- **(d) 0.90:** This would be the recall, not precision

**6. Business context:**
- **High precision** means when you predict a customer will buy, you're usually right
- **Important for** marketing campaigns where false positives are costly
- **Balanced with recall** for overall model performance

**Key insight:** **Precision** measures the **quality** of positive predictions - how many predicted positives are actually positive.

**Problem 6. In the context of the same confusion matrix from question 5, what is the recall (sensitivity) of the classifier?**

*   (a) 0.75
*   (b) 0.80
*   (c) 0.82
*   (d) 0.90

**Correct answers:** (d)

**Explanation:**

**Recall is 0.90** - this measures the ability to find all positive cases.

**Step-by-step calculation:**

**1. Recall formula:**
$\text{Recall} = \frac{\text{True Positives}}{\text{True Positives} + \text{False Negatives}}$

**2. Extract values from confusion matrix:**
- **True Positives (TP):** 90 (Actual 1, Predicted 1)
- **False Negatives (FN):** 10 (Actual 1, Predicted 0)
- **True Negatives (TN):** 80 (Actual 0, Predicted 0)
- **False Positives (FP):** 20 (Actual 0, Predicted 1)

**3. Calculate recall:**
$\text{Recall} = \frac{90}{90 + 10} = \frac{90}{100} = 0.90$

**4. Interpretation:**
- **90% of actual positive cases** are correctly identified
- **10% of actual positive cases** are missed (false negatives)
- **High recall** indicates good sensitivity to positive cases

**5. Comparison with precision:**
- **Precision:** $\frac{90}{110} = 0.82$ (82% of positive predictions are correct)
- **Recall:** $\frac{90}{100} = 0.90$ (90% of actual positives are found)
- **Trade-off:** Higher recall often means lower precision

**6. Business context:**
- **High recall** means you catch most customers who will buy
- **Important for** scenarios where missing positives is costly
- **Balanced with precision** for optimal model performance

**Key insight:** **Recall** measures the **completeness** of positive predictions - how many actual positives are found.

**Problem 7. A machine learning model has a training accuracy of 95% and a validation accuracy of 70%. This is most likely an example of:**

*   (a) Underfitting
*   (b) Overfitting
*   (c) Good generalization
*   (d) Data leakage

**Correct answers:** (b)

**Explanation:**

**This is a classic example of overfitting** - the model performs well on training data but poorly on validation data.

**Why (b) is correct:**

**1. Overfitting characteristics:**
- **High training accuracy:** 95% (model fits training data very well)
- **Low validation accuracy:** 70% (poor generalization to unseen data)
- **Large gap:** 25% difference indicates overfitting
- **Model complexity:** Likely too complex for the data

**2. Mathematical interpretation:**
- **Training error:** 5% (very low)
- **Validation error:** 30% (much higher)
- **Generalization gap:** 25% (significant overfitting)

**3. Why other options are incorrect:**

**Option (a): Underfitting**
- **Underfitting** would show **low training accuracy** (e.g., 60%)
- **Low validation accuracy** would be similar to training
- **Small gap** between training and validation performance

**Option (c): Good generalization**
- **Good generalization** would show **similar** training and validation accuracy
- **Small gap** (e.g., 85% training, 82% validation)
- **Both accuracies** would be reasonably high

**Option (d): Data leakage**
- **Data leakage** would show **unrealistically high** validation accuracy
- **Both training and validation** would be very high
- **Not the pattern** shown here

**4. Causes of overfitting:**
- **Too many parameters** relative to data size
- **Complex model** (high-degree polynomial, deep neural network)
- **Insufficient regularization**
- **Small training dataset**

**5. Solutions for overfitting:**
- **Increase training data**
- **Reduce model complexity**
- **Add regularization** (L1/L2, dropout)
- **Early stopping**
- **Cross-validation** for model selection

**Key insight:** **Large gap** between training and validation performance indicates **overfitting** - the model has memorized training data rather than learning generalizable patterns.

---

**Problem 8. Which of the following regularization techniques is most effective for feature selection?**

*   (a) L1 regularization (Lasso)
*   (b) L2 regularization (Ridge)
*   (c) Dropout
*   (d) Early stopping

**Correct answers:** (a)

**Explanation:**

**L1 regularization (Lasso) is most effective for feature selection** because it can set coefficients exactly to zero.

**Why (a) is correct:**

**1. L1 regularization properties:**
- **Sparsity induction:** Can set coefficients exactly to zero
- **Feature selection:** Automatically selects relevant features
- **Mathematical form:** $\min \|y - Xw\|^2 + \lambda\|w\|_1$
- **L1 norm:** $\|w\|_1 = \sum|w_i|$

**2. Why L1 creates sparsity:**
- **Sharp corners** at axes in constraint region
- **Optimal solution** often at corners (where some $w_i = 0$)
- **Exact zeros** for irrelevant features
- **Automatic feature selection**

**3. Why other options are less effective:**

**Option (b): L2 regularization (Ridge)**
- **Shrinks coefficients** toward zero but rarely to exactly zero
- **Smooth penalty:** $\|w\|_2^2 = \sum w_i^2$
- **No feature selection** - all features get non-zero weights
- **Better for** preventing overfitting, not feature selection

**Option (c): Dropout**
- **Neural network technique** for preventing overfitting
- **Randomly drops** neurons during training
- **Not designed** for feature selection
- **Applies to** hidden layers, not input features

**Option (d): Early stopping**
- **Stops training** before overfitting
- **Doesn't select features** - uses all available features
- **Prevents overfitting** but doesn't reduce feature set

**4. L1 vs L2 comparison:**

**L1 (Lasso):**
- **Sparse solutions** with exact zeros
- **Feature selection** capability
- **Sharp, non-differentiable** penalty
- **Good for** high-dimensional data with many irrelevant features

**L2 (Ridge):**
- **Dense solutions** with small weights
- **No feature selection**
- **Smooth, differentiable** penalty
- **Good for** preventing overfitting

**5. Practical applications:**
- **High-dimensional datasets** with many features
- **When you suspect** many features are irrelevant
- **Interpretable models** with few non-zero coefficients
- **Computational efficiency** with fewer features

**Key insight:** **L1 regularization** is the **only option** that can perform **automatic feature selection** by setting coefficients exactly to zero.

**Problem 9. In cross-validation, what is the main advantage of using k-fold cross-validation over leave-one-out cross-validation?**

*   (a) It's computationally faster
*   (b) It provides better estimates of model performance
*   (c) It's more robust to outliers
*   (d) It requires less data

**Correct answers:** (a)

**Explanation:**

**k-fold cross-validation is computationally faster** than leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation, especially for large datasets.

**Why (a) is correct:**

**1. Computational complexity comparison:**

**Leave-one-out (LOO):**
- **Number of models:** $n$ (one for each data point)
- **Training set size:** $n-1$ for each model
- **Total computation:** $O(n \times \text{training cost})$

**k-fold cross-validation:**
- **Number of models:** $k$ (typically 5 or 10)
- **Training set size:** $(k-1)n/k$ for each model
- **Total computation:** $O(k \times \text{training cost})$

**2. Practical example:**
- **Dataset size:** 10,000 samples
- **LOO:** 10,000 models to train
- **5-fold CV:** 5 models to train
- **Speedup:** 2000x faster

**3. Why other options are incorrect:**

**Option (b): Better performance estimates**
- **LOO** typically provides **less biased** estimates
- **k-fold** has **higher bias** but **lower variance**
- **LOO** is theoretically **unbiased** for many estimators

**Option (c): More robust to outliers**
- **LOO** is actually **more robust** to outliers
- **Each fold** in LOO has minimal impact from outliers
- **k-fold** can be **more sensitive** to outliers in small folds

**Option (d): Requires less data**
- **Both methods** use the same amount of data
- **Data requirements** are identical
- **Not a relevant** advantage

**4. Trade-offs:**

**k-fold advantages:**
- **Computationally efficient**
- **Lower variance** in performance estimates
- **Practical** for large datasets
- **Standard choice** (k=5 or k=10)

**LOO advantages:**
- **Unbiased estimates** for many estimators
- **Maximal use** of training data
- **No randomness** in fold assignment
- **Theoretically optimal** for some cases

**5. When to use each:**
- **k-fold:** Most practical applications, large datasets
- **LOO:** Small datasets, when unbiased estimates are crucial
- **Stratified k-fold:** When maintaining class balance is important

**Key insight:** **Computational efficiency** is the **primary advantage** of k-fold over LOO, making it the **practical choice** for most applications.

**Problem 10. Which of the following is NOT a valid reason for standardizing features before training a machine learning model?**

*   (a) To ensure all features have the same scale
*   (b) To improve convergence speed of gradient descent
*   (c) To make the model more interpretable
*   (d) To increase the model's accuracy

**Correct answers:** (d)

**Explanation:**

**Standardizing features does NOT directly increase model accuracy** - this is not a valid reason for standardization.

**Why (d) is incorrect:**

**1. What standardization does:**
- **Centers** features around zero (mean = 0)
- **Scales** features to unit variance (std = 1)
- **Formula:** $x' = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}$
- **Does NOT change** the underlying relationships in data

**2. Why standardization doesn't increase accuracy:**
- **Linear models** are **scale-invariant** (coefficients adjust)
- **Tree-based models** are **scale-invariant**
- **Neural networks** can learn **appropriate scales**
- **Accuracy depends on** data quality and model choice, not scale

**3. Why other options are valid:**

**Option (a): Same scale**
- **Ensures all features** have comparable ranges
- **Prevents** features with large scales from dominating
- **Important for** distance-based algorithms (k-NN, SVM)

**Option (b): Faster convergence**
- **Gradient descent** converges faster with standardized features
- **Prevents** zigzagging due to different feature scales
- **Important for** optimization algorithms

**Option (c): Better interpretability**
- **Coefficients** become comparable across features
- **Feature importance** is easier to assess
- **Model behavior** is more predictable

**4. When standardization helps:**
- **Distance-based algorithms** (k-NN, SVM, k-means)
- **Gradient-based optimization** (neural networks, logistic regression)
- **Regularization** (L1/L2 penalties are scale-sensitive)
- **Feature comparison** and interpretability

**5. When standardization doesn't help:**
- **Tree-based models** (decision trees, random forests)
- **Scale-invariant algorithms**
- **Already scaled features**
- **Categorical features** (should be encoded, not standardized)

**6. Alternative preprocessing:**
- **Normalization:** Scales to [0,1] range
- **Robust scaling:** Uses median and IQR (outlier-resistant)
- **Feature encoding:** For categorical variables
- **Feature engineering:** Creating new meaningful features

**Key insight:** **Standardization** improves **convergence** and **interpretability**, but **doesn't directly increase accuracy** - the model's performance depends on the underlying data patterns, not the scale of features.

**Problem 11. In a neural network, what is the primary purpose of the activation function?**

*   (a) To increase the number of parameters
*   (b) To introduce non-linearity into the model
*   (c) To reduce computational complexity
*   (d) To normalize the input data

**Correct answers:** (b)

**Explanation:**

**The primary purpose of activation functions is to introduce non-linearity** into neural networks, enabling them to learn complex patterns.

**Why (b) is correct:**

**1. Linear vs non-linear models:**
- **Without activation functions:** Neural network = linear combination of inputs
- **With activation functions:** Neural network = non-linear transformation
- **Mathematical form:** $f(x) = \sigma(Wx + b)$ where $\sigma$ is the activation function

**2. Why non-linearity is crucial:**
- **Linear models** can only learn linear relationships
- **Real-world data** often has non-linear patterns
- **Activation functions** enable learning of complex, non-linear mappings
- **Universal approximation:** Neural networks can approximate any function

**3. Common activation functions:**

**ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit):**
- **Formula:** $f(x) = \max(0, x)$
- **Advantages:** Simple, fast, reduces vanishing gradient
- **Disadvantages:** Dying ReLU problem

**Sigmoid:**
- **Formula:** $f(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}$
- **Advantages:** Smooth, bounded output [0,1]
- **Disadvantages:** Vanishing gradient for large inputs

**Tanh (Hyperbolic Tangent):**
- **Formula:** $f(x) = \frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{e^x + e^{-x}}$
- **Advantages:** Bounded output [-1,1], zero-centered
- **Disadvantages:** Vanishing gradient

**4. Why other options are incorrect:**

**Option (a): Increase parameters**
- **Activation functions** don't add parameters
- **Parameters** come from weights and biases
- **Activation functions** are fixed transformations

**Option (c): Reduce complexity**
- **Activation functions** actually **increase** computational complexity
- **Additional computation** for each neuron
- **Trade-off** for increased modeling power

**Option (d): Normalize data**
- **Activation functions** transform outputs, not normalize inputs
- **Normalization** is typically done in preprocessing
- **Different purpose** from activation functions

**5. Mathematical intuition:**
- **Linear combination:** $z = Wx + b$
- **Non-linear transformation:** $a = \sigma(z)$
- **Without $\sigma$:** Network = linear model
- **With $\sigma$:** Network = non-linear model

**6. Practical implications:**
- **Single layer** with activation = universal approximator
- **Multiple layers** with activations = deep learning
- **Choice of activation** affects training dynamics
- **ReLU** is most popular for hidden layers

**Key insight:** **Activation functions** are essential for **non-linearity**, enabling neural networks to learn **complex patterns** that linear models cannot capture.

**Problem 12. Which of the following loss functions is most appropriate for binary classification?**

*   (a) Mean Squared Error (MSE)
*   (b) Binary Cross-Entropy
*   (c) Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
*   (d) Hinge Loss

**Correct answers:** (b)

**Explanation:**

**Binary Cross-Entropy is most appropriate for binary classification** because it's designed specifically for probability outputs and provides better training dynamics.

**Why (b) is correct:**

**1. Binary Cross-Entropy properties:**
- **Designed for** probability outputs $p \in [0,1]$
- **Mathematical form:** $L = -[y \log(p) + (1-y) \log(1-p)]$
- **Where:** $y$ is true label (0 or 1), $p$ is predicted probability
- **Optimal for** logistic regression and neural networks with sigmoid output

**2. Why Binary Cross-Entropy is ideal:**

**Probability interpretation:**
- **Output represents** probability of positive class
- **Logarithmic penalty** for incorrect predictions
- **Heavily penalizes** confident wrong predictions
- **Encourages** well-calibrated probability estimates

**Training dynamics:**
- **Gradient is well-behaved** for probability outputs
- **Converges faster** than MSE for classification
- **Stable training** with sigmoid/softmax outputs
- **Better optimization** landscape

**3. Why other options are less appropriate:**

**Option (a): Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **Designed for** regression problems
- **Assumes** Gaussian noise in targets
- **Poor training dynamics** for classification
- **Can lead to** slower convergence

**Option (c): Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **Less sensitive** to outliers than MSE
- **Not optimal** for probability outputs
- **Poor gradient** properties for classification
- **Better for** robust regression

**Option (d): Hinge Loss**
- **Designed for** Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- **Requires** margin-based optimization
- **Not compatible** with gradient-based methods
- **Different optimization** approach needed

**4. Mathematical comparison:**

**Binary Cross-Entropy:**
$L_{\text{BCE}} = -[y \log(p) + (1-y) \log(1-p)]$

**MSE:**
$L_{\text{MSE}} = (y - p)^2$

**MAE:**
$L_{\text{MAE}} = |y - p|$

**5. Practical considerations:**

**Problem 13. What is the main difference between Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Batch Gradient Descent?**

*   (a) SGD uses momentum while Batch GD does not
*   (b) SGD updates parameters using a single sample while Batch GD uses all samples
*   (c) SGD is faster but less accurate than Batch GD
*   (d) SGD requires more memory than Batch GD

**Correct answers:** (b)

**Explanation:**

**The main difference is that SGD uses a single sample per update while Batch GD uses all samples** - this is the fundamental distinction between the two methods.

**Why (b) is correct:**

**1. Update mechanism comparison:**

**Batch Gradient Descent:**
- **Uses all training samples** in each update
- **Gradient calculation:** $\nabla L(\theta) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \nabla L_i(\theta)$
- **Update rule:** $\theta_{t+1} = \theta_t - \eta \nabla L(\theta_t)$
- **Deterministic** gradient estimate

**Stochastic Gradient Descent:**
- **Uses single random sample** in each update
- **Gradient calculation:** $\nabla L(\theta) = \nabla L_i(\theta)$ for random $i$
- **Update rule:** $\theta_{t+1} = \theta_t - \eta \nabla L_i(\theta_t)$
- **Stochastic** gradient estimate

**2. Computational characteristics:**

**Batch GD:**
- **Computational cost:** $O(n)$ per update
- **Memory usage:** Must store all gradients
- **Convergence:** Smooth, deterministic path
- **Scalability:** Poor for large datasets

**SGD:**
- **Computational cost:** $O(1)$ per update
- **Memory usage:** Minimal (single sample)
- **Convergence:** Noisy, stochastic path
- **Scalability:** Excellent for large datasets

**3. Why other options are incorrect:**

**Option (a): Momentum usage**
- **Both methods** can use momentum
- **Momentum** is an optimization technique, not a defining characteristic
- **Adam, RMSprop** work with both approaches

**Option (c): Speed vs accuracy**
- **SGD is faster per iteration** but may need more iterations
- **Accuracy depends on** convergence, not the method itself
- **Both can achieve** similar final accuracy

**Option (d): Memory requirements**
- **SGD requires LESS memory** than Batch GD
- **Batch GD** must process all samples simultaneously
- **SGD** processes one sample at a time

**4. Trade-offs:**

**Batch GD advantages:**
- **Stable convergence** with smooth gradients
- **Deterministic** optimization path
- **Better for** small datasets
- **Easier to debug** and analyze

**SGD advantages:**
- **Computationally efficient** per iteration
- **Can escape local minima** due to noise
- **Scalable** to large datasets
- **Online learning** capability

**5. Practical considerations:**
- **Mini-batch SGD** is often the best compromise
- **Batch size** affects convergence and memory usage
- **Learning rate** needs different tuning for each method
- **Dataset size** influences choice of method

**Key insight:** **SGD vs Batch GD** is fundamentally about **sample size per update** - single sample vs all samples, with **different computational and convergence properties**.

**Problem 14. In the context of machine learning, what does the term "bias" refer to?**

*   (a) The difference between predicted and actual values
*   (b) The systematic error that occurs when a model is too simple
*   (c) The random error in the data
*   (d) The difference between training and validation performance

**Correct answers:** (b)

**Explanation:**

**Bias refers to the systematic error that occurs when a model is too simple** to capture the true underlying relationship in the data.

**Why (b) is correct:**

**1. Definition of bias:**
- **Bias** = systematic error due to model assumptions
- **Occurs when** model is too simple (underfitting)
- **Cannot be reduced** by more training data
- **Can be reduced** by increasing model complexity

**2. Mathematical interpretation:**
- **Bias** = $E[\hat{f}(x)] - f(x)$
- **Where:** $\hat{f}(x)$ is model prediction, $f(x)$ is true function
- **High bias** = model consistently misses true pattern
- **Low bias** = model can capture true pattern

**3. Examples of high bias:**
- **Linear model** for non-linear data
- **Simple polynomial** for complex relationship
- **Shallow neural network** for deep patterns
- **Underfitting** scenarios

**4. Why other options are incorrect:**

**Option (a): Difference between predicted and actual**
- **This is prediction error**, not bias
- **Prediction error** = bias + variance + irreducible error
- **Bias** is only one component of total error

**Option (c): Random error in data**
- **This is irreducible error**, not bias
- **Random noise** cannot be eliminated by any model
- **Bias** is systematic, not random

**Option (d): Training vs validation performance**
- **This is overfitting/underfitting**, not bias
- **Performance gap** indicates generalization issues
- **Bias** exists even with perfect generalization

**5. Bias-variance tradeoff:**

**High bias, low variance:**
- **Simple model** (linear regression for complex data)
- **Consistent predictions** but consistently wrong
- **Underfitting** scenario

**Low bias, high variance:**
- **Complex model** (high-degree polynomial)
- **Accurate on average** but inconsistent
- **Overfitting** scenario

**6. Reducing bias:**
- **Increase model complexity**
- **Add more features**
- **Use more sophisticated algorithms**
- **Feature engineering**

**7. Practical implications:**
- **High bias** = model is too simple
- **Low bias** = model can capture true patterns
- **Balance** with variance for optimal performance
- **Cross-validation** helps assess bias-variance tradeoff

**Key insight:** **Bias** represents **systematic error** from **model simplicity** - the model's inability to capture the true underlying relationship in the data.

**Problem 15. Which of the following is a valid approach to handle imbalanced datasets?**

*   (a) Always use accuracy as the evaluation metric
*   (b) Use techniques like SMOTE or class weights
*   (c) Remove samples from the majority class
*   (d) Increase the learning rate

**Correct answers:** (b)

**Explanation:**

**Using techniques like SMOTE or class weights is a valid approach** to handle imbalanced datasets by addressing the class imbalance directly.

**Why (b) is correct:**

**1. SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique):**
- **Creates synthetic samples** for minority class
- **Interpolates** between existing minority samples
- **Balances class distribution** without losing information
- **Reduces overfitting** compared to simple oversampling

**2. Class weights:**
- **Assigns higher weights** to minority class samples

- **Where:** $w_i$ is weight for sample $i$

**3. Why other options are incorrect:**

**Option (a): Always use accuracy**
- **Accuracy is misleading** for imbalanced datasets
- **High accuracy** can be achieved by predicting majority class only
- **Better metrics:** Precision, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC
- **Doesn't address** the imbalance problem

**Option (c): Remove majority samples**
- **Loses valuable information** from majority class
- **Reduces training data** size
- **May create** artificial balance
- **Not recommended** approach

**Option (d): Increase learning rate**
- **Learning rate** affects optimization, not class balance
- **Doesn't address** the fundamental imbalance issue
- **May cause** training instability
- **Unrelated** to class imbalance

**4. Additional techniques for imbalanced datasets:**

**Data-level approaches:**
- **Oversampling:** Duplicate minority samples
- **Undersampling:** Remove majority samples (carefully)
- **SMOTE:** Create synthetic minority samples
- **ADASYN:** Adaptive synthetic sampling

**Algorithm-level approaches:**
- **Class weights:** Penalize majority class more
- **Cost-sensitive learning:** Different costs for different misclassifications
- **Ensemble methods:** Combine multiple models
- **Threshold adjustment:** Modify decision threshold

**5. Evaluation metrics for imbalanced data:**
- **Precision:** Quality of positive predictions
- **Recall:** Completeness of positive predictions
- **F1-score:** Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- **AUC-ROC:** Area under ROC curve
- **Precision-Recall curve:** Better for imbalanced data

**6. Practical considerations:**
- **Understand the domain** and cost of misclassification
- **Choose appropriate** evaluation metrics
- **Consider business** requirements
- **Validate** on representative test set

**Key insight:** **SMOTE and class weights** are **effective techniques** for handling imbalanced datasets by **addressing the imbalance directly** rather than ignoring it or using inappropriate metrics.

- **Provides unbiased** estimate of true performance

**3. Why other options are incorrect:**

**Option (a): Train final model**
- **Training set** is used to train the model
- **Validation set** is for evaluation, not training
- **Final model** should be trained on training + validation

**Option (c): Test final model**
- **Test set** is used for final evaluation

**Problem 20. In the context of clustering, what does the "elbow method" help determine?**

*   (a) The optimal number of clusters
*   (b) The best clustering algorithm
*   (c) The distance metric to use
*   (d) The initialization method

**Correct answers:** (a)

**Explanation:**

**The elbow method helps determine the optimal number of clusters** by analyzing the trade-off between model complexity and performance improvement.

**Why (a) is correct:**

**1. Elbow method concept:**
- **Plots** within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) vs number of clusters
- **WCSS** decreases as number of clusters increases
- **"Elbow" point** indicates optimal number of clusters
- **Beyond elbow:** Diminishing returns from adding more clusters

**2. Mathematical formulation:**

**Within-cluster sum of squares:**
$\text{WCSS} = \sum_{k=1}^{K} \sum_{x_i \in C_k} \|x_i - \mu_k\|^2$

**Where:**
- **$K$** = number of clusters
- **$C_k$** = cluster $k$
- **$\mu_k$** = centroid of cluster $k$
- **$x_i$** = data point $i$

**3. Elbow method process:**
- **Run clustering** for different $K$ values (e.g., 1 to 10)
- **Calculate WCSS** for each $K$
- **Plot WCSS** vs $K$
- **Identify** the "elbow" point where slope changes significantly

**4. Why other options are incorrect:**

**Option (b): Best clustering algorithm**
- **Elbow method** assumes algorithm is already chosen
- **Different algorithms** may have different optimal $K$
- **Algorithm selection** is separate from $K$ selection

**Option (c): Distance metric**
- **Distance metric** affects clustering results
- **Elbow method** works with any distance metric
- **Metric choice** is independent of elbow analysis

**Option (d): Initialization method**
- **Initialization** affects convergence and results
- **Elbow method** evaluates final clustering quality
- **Initialization** is implementation detail, not evaluation method

**5. Visual interpretation:**

**Typical elbow plot:**
- **Steep decline** in WCSS for small $K$
- **Gradual decline** for larger $K$
- **"Elbow"** where slope changes from steep to gradual
- **Optimal $K$** at the elbow point

**6. Alternative methods for $K$ selection:**

**Silhouette analysis:**
- **Measures** how similar objects are to their own cluster
- **Higher values** indicate better clustering
- **Range:** [-1, 1]

**Gap statistic:**
- **Compares** WCSS to expected WCSS under null distribution
- **Larger gap** indicates better clustering
- **More robust** than elbow method

**Information criteria:**
- **AIC/BIC** for model selection
- **Balances** fit and complexity
- **Theoretical** foundation

**7. Practical considerations:**
- **Domain knowledge** should guide $K$ selection
- **Business requirements** may constrain $K$
- **Computational cost** increases with $K$
- **Interpretability** decreases with $K$

**8. Limitations of elbow method:**
- **Subjective** interpretation of "elbow"
- **May not work** for all datasets
- **Assumes** clusters are roughly equal size
- **Sensitive** to data preprocessing

**Key insight:** **Elbow method** is a **heuristic approach** for selecting optimal number of clusters by **balancing model complexity** with **performance improvement**.
