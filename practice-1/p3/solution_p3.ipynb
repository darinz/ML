    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** We should standardize the input data using the mean and\n",
    "standard deviation from the training data. If we use the mean and\n",
    "standard deviation from the test data, we are using extra information\n",
    "(outside of the training data) to make predictions. Consequently, our\n",
    "predictions fit to, and are dependent on, the test set (e.g. if we use 5\n",
    "or 10 testing samples, we would generate different predictions), known\n",

    "SGD.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:** \\* (a) SGD is more memory-efficient because it takes a\n",

    "gradient descent \\* (e) It’s more computationally inefficient to use SGD\n",

    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** The answer is B. The slope is strongly regularized\n",
