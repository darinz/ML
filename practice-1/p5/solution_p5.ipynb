    "**1. If $X$ and $Y$ are independent random variables, which of the following are true?**\n",
    "*   (a) $\\text{Cov}(X, Y) = 0$\n",
    "*   (b) $E[XY] = E[X]E[Y]$\n",
    "*   (c) $\\text{Var}(XY) = \\text{Var}(X)\\text{Var}(Y)$\n",
    "*   (d) $P(X,Y) = P(Y|X)P(X|Y)$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct answers:** (a), (b), (d)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "*   (a) $\\text{Cov}(X,Y) = 0$: True. If $X$ and $Y$ are independent, their covariance is zero because independence implies there is no linear relationship between $X$ and $Y$.\n",
    "*   (b) $E[XY] = E[X]E[Y]$: True. For independent random variables, the expectation of their product is the product of their expectations.\n",
    "*   (c) $\\text{Var}(XY) = \\text{Var}(X)\\text{Var}(Y)$: False. The variance of the product of two independent variables is generally not equal to the product of their variances; it's more complex and requires additional terms.\n",
    "*   (d) $P(X,Y) = P(Y|X)P(X|Y)$: True. For independent random variables, $P(X,Y) = P(X)P(Y)$, which is equivalent to $P(Y|X) = P(Y)$ and $P(X|Y) = P(X)$.\n",

    "**2. A certain disease affects 2% of the population. A diagnostic test for this disease has the following characteristics:**\n",
    "*   **Sensitivity (True Positive Rate):** If a person has the disease, the test returns a positive result with probability 0.90.\n",

    "**Explanation:** Let $D$ be the event that the person has the disease and $T$ be the event that the test result is positive. To find $P(D|T)$, the probability that a person has the disease given a positive test result, we use Bayes' Theorem:\n",

    "$$P(T) = 0.018 + 0.098$$\n",

    "To express this as a fraction, multiply the numerator and denominator by 1000:\n",

    "*   A is false: For example, as we covered in the class, the MLE for the variance is biased.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Correct answers:** (a)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "*   Choice A is the only correct answer. By definition, $A$ is PSD implies that $x^T A x \\geq 0 \\forall x$. We showed in lecture 5 (ridge regression, in the context of $A = X^T X$) that this is equivalent to saying that all eigenvalues of $A$ are non-negative.\n",
    "*   Choice B is incorrect-PSD is not a property of the individual elements of $A$, but rather a property of the entire matrix.\n",
    "*   Choice C is incorrect because if any eigenvalues of $A$ are equal to zero, $A$ is rank deficient and cannot be inverted.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Correct answers:** (a)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** (a) is correct because the primary purpose of using general basis functions in regression is to transform nonlinear relationships into a form that allows linear modeling techniques to be applied. By mapping features into a higher-dimensional space, basis functions can capture nonlinear patterns in the data. (b) is false because general basis functions alone do not perform regularization. (c) is false because using general basis functions typically does not reduce the number of samples required. In fact, using more complex basis functions often requires more data to fit the model accurately. (d) is false because general basis functions often increase the number of features by expanding the feature space (for example, by adding polynomials or interaction terms). This does not simplify the model; rather, it increases its complexity.\n",

    "*   (b) $X^T X + \\lambda I$ is always invertible.\n",
    "*   (c) Increasing $\\lambda$ typically adds bias to the model.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Correct answers:** (c), (e), (f)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "*   (a) is incorrect because $X^T X$ is positive semi-definite, which is not always invertible if $X$ has a non-empty null space.\n",
    "*   (b) is incorrect because when $\\lambda$ is 0, it can be reduced to (a).\n",
    "*   (c) is correct since increasing $\\lambda$ results in an increase to $\\lambda^2/(n + \\lambda)^2(w^T x)^2$ in the biased square term when $n$ is large. Conceptually, the model penalizes large weights, pulling them closer to zero. This constraint often reduces the model's flexibility, which adds bias.\n",
    "*   (d) is incorrect since increasing $\\lambda$ results in a decrease to $\\sigma^2 n/(n + \\lambda)^2 ||x||^2$. Conceptually, it makes the model it less sensitive to fluctuations in the training data, which lowers variance at the cost of potentially increasing bias.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Correct answers:** (b)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** The correct answer is (b), Lasso regression, because Lasso uses L1 regularization while Ridge uses L2. L1 penalizes all weights at the same rate unlike L2, so it encourages higher sparsity in the weights. We want higher sparsity in the weights because we know beforehand that only a small portion of the features are actually relevant. So, we want only a small portion of features to have weight that is not 0. If we used L2 regularization, then more features would have non-zero weight and we would assign meaning to many features that should not have any based on our a priori knowledge.\n",

    "**Which of the following best explains the effect of Lasso regression on the bias-variance tradeoff?**\n",
    "*   (a) Lasso regression reduces both bias and variance simultaneously, leading to a more accurate model.\n",
    "*   (b) Lasso regression reduces bias by shrinking coefficients, often at the expense of increasing variance.\n",
    "*   (c) Lasso regression reduces variance by shrinking coefficients and can increase bias, especially when some features are dropped entirely from the learned predictor.\n",
    "*   (d) Lasso regression increases both bias and variance as it enforces sparsity in the learned predictor.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct answers:** (c)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** The correct answer is (c) because Lasso regression penalizes the $l_1$ norm of the weight vector, which shrinks coefficients (often to 0). This reduces the complexity of our model. A less complex model has higher bias and less variance. (a), (b), (d) are all incorrect because a less complex model has decreased variance.\n",

    "**Explanation:** The correct answer is (a). (b) is incorrect because increasing model complexity usually increases variance. (c) is incorrect because decreasing regularization will usually increase variance. (d) is incorrect because the variance of features is a difference concept than variance of a model—removing the high-variance features could increase or decrease the model variance and there is no way knowing a priori.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** The validation accuracy is likely lower due to overfitting (the model is complex, variance is high). Overfitting happens when a model learns too much detail and noise from the training data, capturing specific patterns that don't apply to new, unseen data.

    "**Explanation:** D is the correct answer, as it is the only approach that avoids overfitting hyperparameters to data from only one or two hospitals. Each hospital may have a different distribution of patients, doctors, outcomes, etc. So we should not expect all data to be IID.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** No, we should not ALWAYS use all the features. In addition to building an accurate model, we also want to build ethically-informed models and this requires us to be thoughtful about what features go into our analyses.

    "**Correct answers:** (d)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** The correct answer(s) are: D. A is incorrect—consider the function $f(x) = |x|$. This is convex but is not differentiable at $x=0$. B is incorrect because a convex function may have multiple connected global minima (e.g., the \"half-pipes\" we discussed when building up ridge regression) or no global minima (e.g., a hyperplane with non-zero slope). C is only true when $f(x)$ is a linear or affine function, but is not true in general (e.g., a bowl is convex, but when you flip it upside down it becomes concave).\n",

    "*   (b) Because binary logistic regression is a convex optimization problem, it has a closed-form solution.\n",
    "*   (c) The softmax function is used when we are classifying $k > 2$ classes. When we are classifying only $k = 2$ classes, softmax regression will overfit, so we use binary logistic regression instead.\n",
    "*   (d) We can use linear regression to solve classification problems, though the model we learn might not be as accurate compared to using logistic/softmax regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct answers:** (d)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** Quadratic features can still lead to overfitting, and while some convex optimization problems (like linear regression) have closed-form solutions, others like logistic regression require iterative methods. Softmax regression's complexity depends on implementation, and linear regression can perform basic classification tasks despite not being optimized for this purpose.\n"
