    "**Explanation:** (a) is correct because the primary purpose of using\n",
    "general basis functions in regression is to transform nonlinear\n",
    "relationships into a form that allows linear modeling techniques to be\n",
    "applied. By mapping features into a higher-dimensional space, basis\n",

    "the number of samples required. In fact, using more complex basis\n",
    "functions often requires more data to fit the model accurately. (d) is\n",
