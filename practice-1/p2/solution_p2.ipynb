    "(a) The error that cannot be eliminated by any model\n",

    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Irreducible error** is the fundamental uncertainty in the data that **cannot be eliminated** by any model, no matter how sophisticated. This error represents the inherent noise or randomness in the data generation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key characteristics:**\n",
    "- **Independent of model choice** - no algorithm can reduce this error\n",
    "- **Represents data uncertainty** - comes from measurement errors, natural variability, or missing information\n",
    "- **Lower bound on performance** - sets the theoretical limit for model accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples of irreducible error:**\n",
    "- Measurement noise in sensors\n",
    "- Natural variability in biological systems\n",
    "- Unpredictable external factors affecting the outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why other options are incorrect:**\n",
    "- **(b)** Overfitting error can be reduced with regularization or more data\n",
    "- **(c)** Underfitting error can be reduced with more complex models\n",

    "\n",
    "**Correct answers:** (a)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **sigmoid function** (also called logistic function) is the core of logistic regression:\n",

    "\n",
    "**Key properties:**\n",
    "- **Output range:** [0, 1] - perfect for probability interpretation\n",
    "- **Smooth and differentiable** - enables gradient-based optimization\n",

    "**Problem 3. Two realtors are creating machine learning models to predict house costs based on house traits (i.e. house size, neighborhood, school district, etc.) trained on the same set of houses, using the same model hyperparameters. Realtor A includes 30 different housing traits in their model. Realtor B includes 5 traits in their model. Which of the following outcomes is most likely?**\n",
    "*   (a) Realtor B's model has higher variance and lower bias than Realtor A's model\n",

    "\n",
    "**Correct answers:** (b)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a classic **bias-variance tradeoff** problem. More features generally lead to **higher variance** but the effect on bias is **uncertain**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Realtor A has higher variance:**\n",
    "- **More parameters to estimate** from the same amount of data\n",
    "- **Higher risk of overfitting** to noise in the training data\n",
    "- **Curse of dimensionality** - data becomes sparse in high-dimensional spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why bias is uncertain:**\n",
    "- **Depends on feature relevance** - if the extra 25 features are informative, bias decreases\n",
    "- **Depends on feature quality** - if the extra features are noise, bias might increase\n",
    "- **Depends on model capacity** - whether the model can effectively use all features\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key insight:** More features **always** increase variance, but bias can go either way depending on feature quality and relevance.\n",

    "**Correct answers:** (d)\n",

    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** loss function, which is the standard loss function for **linear regression**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical form:**\n",
    "\n",
    "$L(w,b) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - (w^T x_i + b))^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key properties:**\n",
    "- **Squared differences** - penalizes large errors more heavily than small ones\n",
    "- **Differentiable** - enables gradient-based optimization\n",
    "- **Convex** - guarantees global minimum\n",
    "- **Maximum likelihood** - equivalent to MLE under Gaussian noise assumption\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why other options are incorrect:**\n",
    "- **(a)** This describes Mean Absolute Error (MAE), not MSE\n",
    "- **(b)** Correlation maximization is not the goal of this loss function\n",
    "- **(c)** MSE can be solved analytically (normal equations), not just with gradient descent\n",

    "**Problem 5. True/False: As the value of the regularization term coefficient in Ridge Regression increases, the sensitivity of predictions to inputs decreases.**\n",
    "*   (a) True\n",
    "*   (b) False\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct answers:** (a)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is **true**. As the regularization coefficient λ increases in Ridge Regression, the model becomes **less sensitive** to input changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical intuition:**\n",
    "The Ridge Regression objective is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\min \\|y - Xw\\|^2 + \\lambda\\|w\\|^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why sensitivity decreases:**\n",
    "- **Smaller coefficients** - λ penalizes large weights, forcing them toward zero\n",
    "- **Smoother predictions** - the model becomes more conservative\n",
    "- **Reduced overfitting** - less responsive to noise in the training data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practical effect:**\n",
    "- **Higher λ** → smaller coefficients → less sensitive to input variations\n",
    "- **Lower λ** → larger coefficients → more sensitive to input variations\n",

    "**Problem 6. Which of the following statements about logistic regression is true?**\n",
    "*   (a) The loss function of logistic regression without regularization is convex, and the loss function of logistic regression with L2 regularization is convex.\n",
    "*   (b) Neither the loss function of logistic regression without regularization is convex nor the loss function of logistic regression with L2 regularization is convex.\n",
    "*   (c) The loss function of logistic regression without regularization is convex, but the loss function of logistic regression with L2 regularization is non-convex.\n",
    "*   (d) The loss function of logistic regression without regularization is non-convex, but the loss function of logistic regression with L2 regularization is convex.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct answers:** (a)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Both logistic regression loss functions are **convex**, which guarantees convergence to the global minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Logistic regression without regularization:**\n",
    "\n",
    "$L(\\theta) = -\\sum_i [y_i \\log(\\sigma(\\theta^T x_i)) + (1-y_i) \\log(1-\\sigma(\\theta^T x_i))]$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Logistic regression with L2 regularization:**\n",
    "\n",
    "$L(\\theta) = -\\sum_i [y_i \\log(\\sigma(\\theta^T x_i)) + (1-y_i) \\log(1-\\sigma(\\theta^T x_i))] + \\lambda\\|\\theta\\|^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why both are convex:**\n",
    "- **Log-likelihood term** - convex (logistic function is log-concave)\n",
    "- **L2 penalty term** - convex (quadratic function)\n",
    "- **Sum of convex functions** - remains convex\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key insight:** Adding L2 regularization **preserves convexity** and actually makes the optimization more stable.\n",

    "**✗ NOT an assumption:**\n",
    "- **(c)** Normal distribution of residuals - this is a **linear regression** assumption\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key differences from linear regression:**\n",
    "- **Logistic regression:** Models probability, uses Bernoulli/binomial distribution\n",
    "- **Linear regression:** Models continuous values, assumes normal residuals\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why normal residuals don't apply:**\n",
    "- Logistic regression predicts **probabilities** (bounded between 0 and 1)\n",
    "- The response follows a **Bernoulli distribution**, not normal\n",
    "- Residuals are not normally distributed in logistic regression\n",

    "**Both LASSO and Ridge regression** can have their optimal λ values change when the validation set is added to the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this happens:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. More training data:**\n",
    "- **Larger training set** → different parameter estimates\n",
    "- **Different data distribution** → different optimal regularization strength\n",
    "- **Reduced variance** → potentially less regularization needed\n",
    "\n",

    "- **LASSO:** More data can change which features are selected\n",
    "- **Ridge:** More data can change the optimal shrinkage amount\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Practical considerations:**\n",
    "- **Data-dependent regularization** - optimal λ depends on the specific dataset\n",
    "- **Sample size effects** - larger datasets often need less regularization\n",
    "- **Distribution shifts** - validation set might have different characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key insight:** The optimal regularization parameter is **data-dependent**, so changing the training data will likely change the optimal λ.\n",
