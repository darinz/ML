    "Saket is building a classification model from a dataset with two classes of student reactions to the jokes he makes during section: Funny jokes (F) and Dull Jokes (D). The probability of a randomly selected joke being funny is 0.3. The probability the model makes the correct classification given that the joke is dull is 0.7, and the probability the model makes the correct classification given that a joke is funny is 0.2. What is the probability that a randomly selected joke is dull given that it has been classified as dull?\n",
