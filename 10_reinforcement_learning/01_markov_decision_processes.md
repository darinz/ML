# Reinforcement Learning: Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)

This section introduces the foundational concepts of reinforcement learning (RL) through the lens of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). The goal is to provide both mathematical rigor and intuitive understanding, so you can apply these ideas to real-world problems.

## The Big Picture: What is Reinforcement Learning?

**The RL Problem:**
Imagine you're trying to teach a robot to navigate through a maze, or a computer program to play chess, or even a child to ride a bicycle. In all these cases, you can't simply provide a step-by-step instruction manual because the environment is complex, uncertain, and the "right" action depends on the current situation. This is exactly what reinforcement learning solves - learning to make good decisions through experience and feedback.

**The Intuitive Analogy:**
Think of reinforcement learning like learning to play a new video game. You don't have a manual telling you exactly what to do at every moment. Instead, you:
- **Try different actions** and see what happens
- **Get feedback** (points, lives, game over) based on your choices
- **Learn patterns** about which actions lead to good outcomes
- **Improve your strategy** over time to get better scores

**Why RL Matters:**
- **No explicit supervision**: Unlike supervised learning, there's no "correct answer" provided
- **Sequential decision making**: Current actions affect future possibilities
- **Uncertainty**: The environment is unpredictable and dynamic
- **Long-term planning**: Need to balance immediate vs. future rewards

### The Key Insight

**From Supervised to Reinforcement Learning:**
- **Supervised Learning**: "Here's the right answer for each input"
- **Reinforcement Learning**: "Here's feedback on how well you're doing, figure out the best strategy"

**The Learning Paradigm Shift:**
- **Exploration**: Try different actions to understand the environment
- **Exploitation**: Use what you've learned to get better rewards
- **Trial and Error**: Learn from mistakes and successes
- **Adaptation**: Continuously improve based on experience

## What is Reinforcement Learning?

In supervised learning, algorithms learn to mimic provided labels $`y`$ for each input $`x`$. But in many real-world scenarios—like teaching a robot to walk—there are no explicit labels for the "right" action. Instead, we only know if the agent is doing well or poorly, based on a **reward function**.

**Key idea:**
- The agent interacts with an environment, receives rewards, and must learn a policy to maximize its long-term reward.
- There is no teacher providing the correct answer at each step; the agent must discover good strategies through trial and error.

**Real-world analogy:**
- Training a dog: You can't tell the dog exactly what to do at every moment, but you can reward it for good behavior and discourage bad behavior. Over time, the dog learns which actions lead to more rewards.

**The Dog Training Analogy:**
- **Agent**: The dog learning new behaviors
- **Environment**: The world around the dog (home, park, etc.)
- **Actions**: Commands the dog can follow (sit, stay, come, etc.)
- **States**: Situations the dog encounters (owner calling, seeing food, etc.)
- **Rewards**: Treats, praise, or corrections based on behavior
- **Policy**: The dog's learned strategy for different situations

## Understanding Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)

### The Big Picture: What is an MDP?

**The MDP Problem:**
How do we mathematically model situations where an agent makes decisions in an uncertain environment? How do we capture the fact that current actions affect future possibilities, and that the environment is unpredictable?

**The Intuitive Analogy:**
Think of an MDP like playing a board game where:
- **States**: Different positions on the board
- **Actions**: Legal moves you can make
- **Transitions**: How the board changes when you make a move
- **Rewards**: Points you get for different moves
- **Uncertainty**: Sometimes dice rolls or other players affect the outcome

**Why MDPs Matter:**
- **Mathematical foundation**: Provides a rigorous framework for decision-making
- **Uncertainty handling**: Models the unpredictability of real environments
- **Sequential decisions**: Captures how current choices affect future options
- **Optimal planning**: Enables finding the best long-term strategy

### The Key Insight

**From Simple Decisions to Sequential Planning:**
- **Single decision**: "What should I do right now?"
- **Sequential decisions**: "What should I do now to set up good options later?"

**The Planning Revolution:**
- **Look ahead**: Consider future consequences of current actions
- **Balance trade-offs**: Immediate rewards vs. long-term benefits
- **Handle uncertainty**: Plan for multiple possible outcomes
- **Adapt strategies**: Change plans based on new information

## 15.1 Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)

An MDP is a mathematical framework for modeling decision-making in situations where outcomes are partly random and partly under the control of a decision maker.

**Intuitive Understanding:**
An MDP is like having a "decision-making recipe" that tells you:
- What situations you might be in (states)
- What choices you can make (actions)
- How your choices affect what happens next (transitions)
- How good or bad different outcomes are (rewards)
- How much you care about future vs. immediate rewards (discounting)

**Formal definition:**
A Markov decision process is a tuple $`(S, A, \{P_{sa}\}, \gamma, R)`$, where:
- $`S`$: set of **states** (e.g., all possible positions and orientations of a robot)
- $`A`$: set of **actions** (e.g., all possible moves the robot can make)
- $`P_{sa}`$: **state transition probabilities**; for each $`s \in S`$ and $`a \in A`$, $`P_{sa}`$ is a distribution over $S$ (i.e., what is the probability of ending up in each possible next state if you take action $a$ in state $s$?)
- $`\gamma \in [0, 1)`$: **discount factor** (how much we care about future rewards)
- $`R : S \times A \to \mathbb{R}`$: **reward function** (how much immediate reward do we get for taking action $a$ in state $s$?)

**The MDP Components Analogy:**
- **States ($`S`$)**: Like different rooms in a house - each room is a different situation
- **Actions ($`A`$)**: Like the moves you can make in each room (open door, turn light on, etc.)
- **Transitions ($`P_{sa}`$)**: Like knowing which room you'll end up in when you open a door
- **Rewards ($`R`$)**: Like how comfortable or useful each room is
- **Discount ($`\gamma`$)**: Like how much you care about future comfort vs. immediate comfort

**Intuitive explanation:**
- The agent starts in some state $`s_0`$.
- At each time step, it chooses an action $`a_t`$.
- The environment transitions to a new state $`s_{t+1}`$ according to $`P_{s_t a_t}`$.
- The agent receives a reward $`R(s_t, a_t)`$.
- The process repeats.

**The Decision-Making Process:**
1. **Observe**: See what situation you're in (current state)
2. **Decide**: Choose what to do (action)
3. **Act**: Execute your choice
4. **Observe**: See what happens (new state and reward)
5. **Learn**: Update your understanding based on the outcome
6. **Repeat**: Continue making decisions

**Diagram:**

```math
s_0 \xrightarrow{a_0} s_1 \xrightarrow{a_1} s_2 \xrightarrow{a_2} s_3 \xrightarrow{a_3} \ldots
```

**Total payoff:**

```math
R(s_0, a_0) + \gamma R(s_1, a_1) + \gamma^2 R(s_2, a_2) + \cdots
```

The discount factor $`\gamma`$ ensures that immediate rewards are more valuable than distant future rewards. This models the idea that "a reward today is worth more than a reward tomorrow."

**The Discount Factor Intuition:**
- **$`\gamma = 0`$**: Only care about immediate rewards (very short-sighted)
- **$`\gamma = 0.9`$**: Care a lot about future rewards (long-term planning)
- **$`\gamma = 1`$**: Care equally about all rewards (no time preference)

**The Money Analogy:**
- **Immediate reward**: Like getting $100 today
- **Future reward**: Like getting $100 next year
- **Discount factor**: Like the interest rate - money today is worth more than money later

---

## The Goal: Maximizing Expected Return

The agent's objective is to choose actions over time to maximize the expected sum of discounted rewards:

```math
\mathbb{E} \left[ R(s_0) + \gamma R(s_1) + \gamma^2 R(s_2) + \cdots \right]
```

**Intuitive Understanding:**
This is like trying to maximize your total happiness over your entire life, where:
- **Immediate happiness**: Rewards you get right now
- **Future happiness**: Rewards you'll get later
- **Expected**: Average over all possible futures (since the future is uncertain)
- **Discounted**: Future happiness is worth less than current happiness

**The Life Planning Analogy:**
- **Short-term decisions**: Should I study tonight or go to a party?
- **Long-term consequences**: Studying might lead to better grades, better job, more money
- **Balancing act**: Enjoy life now vs. invest in future happiness
- **Uncertainty**: You don't know exactly what will happen in the future

**Why discount?**
- **Encourages the agent to seek rewards sooner rather than later**: Like preferring to get paid today rather than next year
- **Ensures the sum converges for infinite-horizon problems**: Prevents infinite rewards from making the math impossible
- **Models uncertainty about the future**: The environment might end at any time, so future rewards are less certain

**The Restaurant Analogy:**
- **Immediate reward**: How good the food tastes right now
- **Future reward**: How healthy you'll be in the future
- **Discounting**: You might prefer delicious unhealthy food now over healthy food later
- **Balancing**: Finding the right mix of immediate and long-term satisfaction

## Policies and Value Functions

### Understanding Policies and Values

**The Policy-Value Challenge:**
How do we represent what the agent should do in each situation? How do we measure how good different strategies are?

**Key Questions:**
- How do we describe the agent's behavior?
- How do we evaluate how good a strategy is?
- How do we compare different strategies?
- How do we find the best strategy?

### Policies

**Policy ($`\pi`$):**
- A function $`\pi : S \to A`$ mapping states to actions.
- The agent "executes" a policy by always choosing $`a = \pi(s)`$ in state $s$.

**Intuitive Understanding:**
A policy is like a strategy or plan that tells you what to do in every possible situation. It's like having a rulebook that says "if you're in situation X, do action Y."

**The Strategy Analogy:**
- **Policy**: Like a chess strategy that tells you what move to make in each position
- **State**: Like the current board position
- **Action**: Like the move you choose to make
- **Execution**: Like following your strategy throughout the game

**Examples of Policies:**
- **Always go left**: Simple but might not be optimal
- **Follow the wall**: Good for maze navigation
- **Greedy policy**: Always choose the action that gives the highest immediate reward
- **Random policy**: Choose actions randomly (useful for exploration)

### Value Functions

**Value function ($`V^{\pi}`$):**
- Measures how good it is to start in state $s$ and follow policy $\pi$ thereafter.

```math
V^{\pi}(s) = \mathbb{E} \left[ R(s_0) + \gamma R(s_1) + \gamma^2 R(s_2) + \cdots \mid s_0 = s, \pi \right]
```

**Intuitive Understanding:**
The value function is like a "score prediction" - it tells you how much total reward you expect to get if you start from a particular situation and follow a particular strategy.

**The Investment Analogy:**
- **State**: Like your current financial situation
- **Policy**: Like your investment strategy
- **Value function**: Like predicting how much money you'll have in the future
- **Expected return**: Like the average outcome over many possible scenarios

**The Bellman Equation Intuition:**
The Bellman equation says: "The value of where you are now equals the immediate reward you get plus the expected value of where you'll end up next."

**Bellman equation for $`V^{\pi}`$:**

```math
V^{\pi}(s) = R(s) + \gamma \sum_{s' \in S} P_{s \pi(s)}(s') V^{\pi}(s')
```

**Step-by-step intuition:**
- **$`R(s)`$**: The immediate reward you get for being in state $s$
- **$`P_{s \pi(s)}(s')`$**: The probability of ending up in state $s'$ when you take action $\pi(s)$ in state $s$
- **$`V^{\pi}(s')`$**: The expected future value if you start from state $s'$ and follow policy $\pi$
- **$`\gamma`$**: The discount factor that makes future rewards worth less than immediate rewards

**The Restaurant Chain Analogy:**
- **Current restaurant**: Your immediate dining experience
- **Next restaurant**: Where you'll eat next (based on your dining strategy)
- **Immediate satisfaction**: How good the current meal is
- **Future satisfaction**: How good your future meals will be
- **Total satisfaction**: Current meal + expected future meals

---

## The Optimal Value Function and Policy

### Understanding Optimality

**The Optimality Challenge:**
How do we find the best possible strategy? How do we know when we've found the optimal solution?

**Key Questions:**
- What makes a policy "optimal"?
- How do we find the best possible strategy?
- How do we know we've found the optimal solution?
- What properties does the optimal solution have?

### Optimal Value Function

**Optimal value function ($`V^*`$):**

```math
V^*(s) = \max_{\pi} V^{\pi}(s)
```

- $V^*(s)$ is the best possible expected sum of discounted rewards starting from $s$.

**Intuitive Understanding:**
The optimal value function is like knowing the "best possible score" you could achieve from any starting position. It's the gold standard - no strategy can do better than this.

**The High Score Analogy:**
- **Value function**: Like your current high score in a game
- **Optimal value function**: Like the world record - the best score anyone has ever achieved
- **Achieving optimality**: Like breaking the world record
- **Impossibility of doing better**: Like knowing you can't possibly score higher than the world record

### Bellman Optimality Equation

**Bellman optimality equation:**

```math
V^*(s) = R(s) + \max_{a \in A} \gamma \sum_{s' \in S} P_{sa}(s') V^*(s')
```

**Intuitive Understanding:**
The Bellman optimality equation says: "The optimal value of a state equals the immediate reward plus the best possible expected future value over all possible actions."

**The Decision Tree Analogy:**
- **Current state**: Like being at a crossroads
- **Actions**: Like the different paths you can take
- **Future states**: Like where each path leads
- **Optimal choice**: Like choosing the path that leads to the best overall outcome
- **Value calculation**: Like calculating the total value of each possible path

**Step-by-step breakdown:**
1. **$`R(s)`$**: Get the immediate reward for being in state $s$
2. **$`\max_{a \in A}`$**: Consider all possible actions and choose the best one
3. **$`\sum_{s' \in S} P_{sa}(s')`$**: For each action, consider all possible next states
4. **$`V^*(s')`$**: Use the optimal value of each next state
5. **$`\gamma`$**: Discount future rewards

### Optimal Policy

**Optimal policy ($`\pi^*`$):**

```math
\pi^*(s) = \arg\max_{a \in A} \sum_{s' \in S} P_{sa}(s') V^*(s')
```

- The optimal policy always chooses the action that leads to the highest expected value.

**Intuitive Understanding:**
The optimal policy is like having the perfect strategy - it always tells you to do exactly what will lead to the best possible long-term outcome.

**The Perfect Coach Analogy:**
- **Optimal policy**: Like having the perfect coach who always gives you the best advice
- **State**: Like the current game situation
- **Action**: Like the coach's recommendation
- **Optimal choice**: Like the coach always choosing the move that leads to victory
- **Consistency**: Like the coach's advice always being the best possible

**Key property:**
- The same optimal policy $\pi^*$ is optimal for all states $s$.

**Why this matters:**
- **Consistency**: The best strategy doesn't change depending on where you start
- **Universality**: One optimal policy works everywhere
- **Simplicity**: You don't need different strategies for different situations

## Algorithms: Value Iteration and Policy Iteration

### Understanding Algorithm Design

**The Algorithm Challenge:**
How do we actually compute the optimal value function and policy? How do we solve the Bellman equations efficiently?

**Key Questions:**
- How do we find the optimal solution computationally?
- What are the trade-offs between different algorithms?
- How do we know when we've converged?
- How do we handle large state spaces?

### Value Iteration

A dynamic programming algorithm to compute $V^\ast$ and $\pi^\ast$ for finite MDPs.

**Intuitive Understanding:**
Value iteration is like solving a puzzle by working backwards. You start with a rough guess of how good each position is, then repeatedly improve your estimates by considering the best possible moves.

**The Puzzle Solving Analogy:**
- **Initial guess**: Like starting with a rough sketch of the solution
- **Iterative improvement**: Like refining your sketch step by step
- **Backward reasoning**: Like working from the end goal back to the current position
- **Convergence**: Like the sketch becoming more and more accurate

**Algorithm:**
1. Initialize $V(s) := 0$ for all $s$.
2. Repeat until convergence:
    - For each state $s$:

```math
V(s) := R(s) + \max_{a \in A} \gamma \sum_{s'} P_{sa}(s') V(s')
```

3. After convergence, extract the optimal policy:

```math
\pi^*(s) = \arg\max_{a \in A} \sum_{s'} P_{sa}(s') V(s')
```

**The Learning Process:**
- **Step 1**: Start with zero knowledge (all values are 0)
- **Step 2**: For each state, ask "what's the best I can do from here?"
- **Step 3**: Update your estimate based on the best possible outcome
- **Step 4**: Repeat until your estimates stop changing

**Why This Works:**
- **Monotonic improvement**: Each iteration makes the estimates better
- **Contraction mapping**: The process converges to the optimal solution
- **Finite convergence**: For finite MDPs, it always converges in finite time

### Policy Iteration

Another dynamic programming algorithm for finite MDPs.

**Intuitive Understanding:**
Policy iteration is like improving a strategy step by step. You start with any strategy, evaluate how good it is, then improve it by choosing better actions, and repeat until you can't improve anymore.

**The Strategy Refinement Analogy:**
- **Initial strategy**: Like starting with any chess opening
- **Evaluation**: Like analyzing how well the opening works
- **Improvement**: Like finding better moves in the opening
- **Iteration**: Like repeating the process until you have the best opening

**Algorithm:**
1. Initialize $\pi$ randomly.
2. Repeat until convergence:
    - **Policy evaluation:** Compute $V^{\pi}$ for the current policy (by solving the Bellman equations).
    - **Policy improvement:** For each state $s$, update $\pi(s)$ to the action that maximizes expected value:

```math
\pi(s) := \arg\max_{a \in A} \sum_{s'} P_{sa}(s') V(s')
```

**The Two-Phase Process:**
- **Evaluation phase**: "How good is my current strategy?"
- **Improvement phase**: "How can I make my strategy better?"
- **Iteration**: Keep evaluating and improving until optimal

**Comparison:**
- **Value iteration**: Updates value estimates directly, always assuming the best action
- **Policy iteration**: Alternates between evaluating the current policy and improving it
- **Both converge**: To the optimal policy for finite MDPs
- **Trade-offs**: Value iteration is simpler, policy iteration can be faster

## Learning the Model: Estimating $P_{sa}$ and $R$

### Understanding Model Learning

**The Model Learning Challenge:**
In many real-world problems, the agent doesn't know how the environment works. How do we learn the transition probabilities and reward function from experience?

**Key Questions:**
- How do we estimate unknown model parameters?
- How much data do we need for accurate estimates?
- How do we handle uncertainty in our estimates?
- How do we balance exploration and exploitation?

### Estimating Transition Probabilities

**How to estimate $P_{sa}$?**
- Run many episodes, record $(s, a, s')$ transitions.
- Estimate $P_{sa}(s')$ as:

```math
P_{sa}(s') = \frac{\#\text{times took action } a \text{ in state } s \text{ and got to } s'}{\#\text{times took action } a \text{ in state } s}
```

**Intuitive Understanding:**
This is like learning the rules of a game by playing it many times and observing what happens when you make different moves.

**The Game Learning Analogy:**
- **Unknown rules**: Like playing a new board game without reading the manual
- **Trial and error**: Like trying different moves and seeing what happens
- **Pattern recognition**: Like noticing that certain moves always lead to certain outcomes
- **Probability estimation**: Like calculating the chance of each outcome for each move

**The Coin Flip Analogy:**
- **Unknown probability**: Like not knowing if a coin is fair
- **Data collection**: Like flipping the coin many times
- **Estimation**: Like counting heads vs. tails to estimate the probability
- **Convergence**: Like the estimate getting more accurate with more flips

**Practical Considerations:**
- **Exploration**: Need to try each action in each state many times
- **Uncertainty**: Estimates are more uncertain with less data
- **Prior knowledge**: Can use uniform distribution as a starting point
- **Online updates**: Can update estimates as new data arrives

### Estimating Rewards

**How to estimate $R(s)$?**
- Average the observed rewards received in state $s$ (or for $(s, a)$ if rewards depend on actions).

**Intuitive Understanding:**
This is like learning how good different situations are by experiencing them and averaging the outcomes.

**The Restaurant Rating Analogy:**
- **Unknown quality**: Like not knowing how good a restaurant is
- **Multiple visits**: Like going to the restaurant several times
- **Averaging**: Like calculating the average satisfaction across all visits
- **Convergence**: Like the rating becoming more accurate with more visits

**Practical tip:**
- Keep running totals for each $(s, a, s')$ and $(s, a)$ pair to efficiently update your estimates as you gather more data.

**The Running Average Analogy:**
- **Incremental updates**: Like updating your GPA after each semester
- **Efficiency**: Like not needing to recalculate from scratch each time
- **Memory**: Like keeping track of total points and number of courses
- **Accuracy**: Like the estimate getting more stable over time

## Putting It All Together: Model-Based RL Loop

### Understanding the Complete Learning Process

**The Integration Challenge:**
How do we combine model learning, value estimation, and policy improvement into a complete learning system?

**Key Questions:**
- How do we balance exploration and exploitation?
- How do we integrate model learning with planning?
- How do we ensure the system improves over time?
- How do we handle the exploration-exploitation trade-off?

### The Complete Learning Loop

1. **Initialize $\pi$ randomly.**
2. **Repeat:**
    1. Execute $\pi$ in the environment for several episodes, collecting data.
    2. Update your estimates of $P_{sa}$ and $R$ using the new data.
    3. Use value iteration or policy iteration with the estimated model to compute a new policy.
    4. Update $\pi$ to the new policy.

**Intuitive Understanding:**
This is like the scientific method applied to decision-making:
1. **Hypothesize**: Start with a guess about the best strategy
2. **Experiment**: Try the strategy and collect data
3. **Analyze**: Learn from the data how the environment works
4. **Improve**: Use your new understanding to create a better strategy
5. **Repeat**: Keep improving through continuous experimentation

**The Scientific Method Analogy:**
- **Hypothesis**: Your current policy (strategy)
- **Experiment**: Executing the policy in the environment
- **Data collection**: Recording what happens (transitions and rewards)
- **Analysis**: Learning the model parameters
- **Conclusion**: Computing a new, better policy
- **Iteration**: Repeating the process to improve further

**Key insight:**
- This loop alternates between exploring the environment, updating your model, and planning the best actions based on your current knowledge.
- Over time, your policy improves as your model and value estimates become more accurate.

**The Learning Cycle:**
- **Exploration**: Try different actions to understand the environment
- **Model learning**: Build a model of how the environment works
- **Planning**: Use the model to find the best strategy
- **Execution**: Try the new strategy
- **Improvement**: The cycle continues, getting better over time

**The Exploration-Exploitation Trade-off:**
- **Exploration**: Try new actions to learn more about the environment
- **Exploitation**: Use what you've learned to get good rewards
- **Balancing**: Need both to learn effectively and perform well
- **Adaptation**: Shift from exploration to exploitation over time

## Summary and Best Practices

### Key Takeaways

- **MDPs provide a powerful framework** for modeling sequential decision-making under uncertainty.

### The Broader Impact

Reinforcement learning and MDPs have fundamentally changed how we approach AI by:
- **Enabling autonomous decision-making**: Systems that can learn to make good decisions
- **Handling uncertainty**: Robust strategies that work despite unpredictability
- **Long-term planning**: Balancing immediate and future rewards
- **Adaptive behavior**: Systems that improve through experience

**Analogy:**
- Think of RL as learning to play a new game: you try different strategies, learn from the outcomes, and gradually improve your play as you understand the rules and consequences better.

**The Game Learning Analogy:**
- **New game**: Like encountering a new problem or environment
- **Strategy trial**: Like trying different approaches
- **Outcome learning**: Like understanding what works and what doesn't
- **Strategy improvement**: Like refining your approach based on experience
- **Mastery**: Like becoming expert at the game

### Best Practices

1. **Start simple**: Begin with small, well-understood problems
2. **Use appropriate discounting**: Balance immediate vs. future rewards
3. **Explore thoroughly**: Make sure you've seen enough of the environment
4. **Update regularly**: Keep your model current with new data
5. **Monitor convergence**: Ensure your algorithms are actually improving
6. **Handle uncertainty**: Account for the fact that your model is imperfect

## From Discrete to Continuous State Spaces

We've now explored **Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)** - the foundational mathematical framework for reinforcement learning. We've seen how MDPs model sequential decision-making under uncertainty, how value and policy iteration algorithms can solve finite MDPs optimally, and how these methods provide the theoretical foundation for learning optimal behavior through interaction with environments.

However, while finite MDPs provide excellent intuition and work well for problems with small, discrete state spaces, **real-world problems** often involve continuous state variables that cannot be easily discretized. Consider a robot navigating through space - its position, velocity, and orientation are all continuous variables that can take infinitely many values.

This motivates our exploration of **continuous state MDPs** - extending the MDP framework to handle infinite or continuous state spaces. We'll see how discretization can approximate continuous problems, how value function approximation enables learning in high-dimensional spaces, and how these techniques bridge the gap between theoretical MDPs and practical applications in robotics, control, and real-world decision-making.

The transition from discrete to continuous state spaces represents the bridge from theoretical foundations to practical applications - taking our understanding of MDPs and extending it to handle the complexity and richness of real-world problems.

In the next section, we'll explore discretization techniques, value function approximation methods, and practical algorithms for solving continuous state MDPs.
