### Learning Approach

The curriculum follows a progressive learning path that builds from fundamental concepts to advanced applications. Each topic includes theoretical foundations, mathematical derivations, and practical implementation examples. The material emphasizes both understanding the underlying principles and developing hands-on coding skills.

#### Active Learning Strategies
- **Rederive all calculations**: Don't just read the mathâ€”work through every derivation step-by-step on paper or in a notebook
- **Implement from scratch**: Retype code examples into your own Jupyter notebook or Python environment, then modify and experiment
- **Build incrementally**: Start with simple implementations and gradually add complexity
- **Test your understanding**: After each concept, try to explain it to yourself or others without referring to notes

#### Retention Techniques
- **Spaced repetition**: Review previous concepts regularly, especially before moving to related topics
- **Create your own examples**: Apply algorithms to datasets you're interested in or create synthetic data
- **Document your learning**: Keep a learning journal with key insights, common pitfalls, and personal examples
- **Teach others**: Explain concepts to peers or write blog posts about what you've learned
- **Build a portfolio**: Implement projects that combine multiple concepts from different sections

#### Practical Implementation
- **Use version control**: Track your code changes and experiments with Git
- **Experiment systematically**: Vary one parameter at a time and document the results
- **Visualize everything**: Create plots and graphs to understand data distributions, model behavior, and results
- **Compare implementations**: Try different approaches to the same problem and analyze trade-offs
