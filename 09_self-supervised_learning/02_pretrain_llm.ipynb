    "## The Big Picture: Why Large Language Models Matter\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Language Understanding Challenge:**\n",
    "Imagine trying to teach a computer to understand and generate human language. Language is incredibly complex - it has grammar, context, ambiguity, idioms, cultural references, and infinite possible combinations. Traditional approaches required hand-crafted rules and extensive labeled data for each specific task.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Intuitive Analogy:**\n",
    "Think of the difference between:\n",
    "- **Traditional NLP**: Like teaching a computer specific rules for each language task (translation, summarization, question answering)\n",
    "- **Large Language Models**: Like teaching a computer to read and understand language the way humans do - by absorbing massive amounts of text and learning patterns naturally\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Large Language Models Matter:**\n",
    "- **Universal language understanding**: One model can handle many different language tasks\n",
    "- **Massive knowledge base**: Learns from billions of documents and conversations\n",
    "- **Emergent capabilities**: Develops abilities not explicitly trained for\n",
    "- **Human-like reasoning**: Can understand context, follow instructions, and generate coherent text\n",
    "- **Democratization**: Makes advanced language AI accessible to more applications\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Key Insight\n",
    "\n",
    "**From Task-Specific to General Language Intelligence:**\n",
    "- **Traditional approach**: Train separate models for each language task\n",
    "- **LLM approach**: Train one massive model that understands language broadly\n",
    "- **Adaptation**: Use the same model for translation, summarization, coding, reasoning, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Foundation Model Advantage:**\n",
    "- **Scale**: Larger models often perform better and have emergent capabilities\n",
    "- **Knowledge transfer**: What you learn about language helps with all language tasks\n",
    "- **Few-shot learning**: Can learn new tasks with just a few examples\n",
    "- **Zero-shot capabilities**: Can handle tasks it was never explicitly trained for\n",
    "\n",
    "Natural language processing is another area where pretraining models are particularly successful. In language problems, an example typically corresponds to a document or generally a sequence (or trunk) of words,[^5] denoted by $x = (x_1, \\cdots, x_T)$ where $T$ is the length of the document/sequence, $x_i \\in \\{1, \\cdots, V\\}$ are words in the document, and $V$ is the vocabulary size.[^6]\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Language Data Structure:**\n",
    "- **Sequence nature**: Language is inherently sequential (words come in order)\n",
    "- **Variable length**: Documents can be short (tweets) or long (books)\n",
    "- **Vocabulary size**: Large vocabularies (50K-100K+ words) create complexity\n",
    "- **Context dependency**: Meaning depends on surrounding words\n",
    "\n",
    "## From General Foundation Models to Language-Specific Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "We've now explored **self-supervised learning and foundation models** - a paradigm shift that enables learning from vast amounts of unlabeled data. We've seen how contrastive learning works by creating surrogate tasks from the data itself, how foundation models can be adapted to various downstream tasks, and how this approach addresses the fundamental data labeling bottleneck in machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, while the general principles of self-supervised learning apply across different data modalities, **natural language processing** presents unique challenges and opportunities that require specialized approaches. Language has its own structure, patterns, and characteristics that make it particularly well-suited for certain types of self-supervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Language-Specific Challenges:**\n",
    "- **Sequential nature**: Words depend on previous words in complex ways\n",
    "- **Context sensitivity**: Same word can mean different things in different contexts\n",
    "- **Long-range dependencies**: Important information can be far apart in text\n",
    "- **Ambiguity**: Many words and phrases have multiple meanings\n",
    "- **Cultural knowledge**: Understanding requires world knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Language-Specific Opportunities:**\n",
    "- **Predictive structure**: Language has strong predictive patterns\n",
    "- **Self-supervised tasks**: Many natural tasks can be created from text itself\n",
    "- **Massive data**: Text data is abundant and easily accessible\n",
    "- **Transfer learning**: Language knowledge transfers well across tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "This motivates our exploration of **large language models (LLMs)** - specialized foundation models for text that leverage the sequential and contextual nature of language. We'll see how language modeling works through the chain rule of probability, how Transformer architectures process text, and how these models can generate coherent text and adapt to new tasks through prompting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The LLM Revolution:**\n",
    "- **Scale**: Models with billions of parameters trained on massive text corpora\n",
    "- **Architecture**: Transformer architecture enables parallel processing and long-range attention\n",
    "- **Training**: Self-supervised learning on next-word prediction\n",
    "- **Capabilities**: Text generation, understanding, reasoning, and task adaptation\n",
    "\n",
    "The transition from general foundation models to language-specific applications represents the bridge from universal principles to domain expertise - taking our understanding of self-supervised learning and applying it to the rich, structured world of natural language.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we'll explore how language models work, how they're trained on massive text corpora, and how they can be adapted to various language tasks through finetuning, zero-shot learning, and in-context learning.\n",

    "## Understanding Language Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Big Picture: What is Language Modeling?\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Core Problem:**\n",
    "Language modeling is about predicting what comes next in a sequence of words. Given some text, we want to predict the probability of the next word, or the probability of entire sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Intuitive Analogy:**\n",
    "- **Language modeling**: Like predicting what someone will say next in a conversation\n",
    "- **Probability estimation**: Like guessing how likely different responses are\n",
    "- **Context understanding**: Like using what was said before to make better predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Language Modeling Matters:**\n",
    "- **Foundation for all NLP**: Most language tasks can be framed as language modeling\n",
    "- **Natural self-supervised task**: No labels needed - just predict the next word\n",
    "- **Universal representation**: Learns general language understanding\n",
    "- **Scalable training**: Can use any text data for training\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction to Language Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "Language modeling is one of the most fundamental tasks in natural language processing. At its core, it involves predicting the probability of sequences of words, which requires understanding the complex patterns and relationships in human language.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Language Understanding Challenge:**\n",
    "- **Complexity**: Language has infinite possible combinations\n",
    "- **Context**: Meaning depends on surrounding words and world knowledge\n",
    "- **Ambiguity**: Same words can mean different things\n",
    "- **Structure**: Grammar, syntax, and semantic relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Learning Approach:**\n",
    "- **Pattern recognition**: Learn statistical patterns from massive text data\n",
    "- **Context modeling**: Understand how words relate to each other\n",
    "- **Knowledge acquisition**: Absorb factual and conceptual knowledge\n",
    "- **Generalization**: Apply learned patterns to new situations\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Language Modeling Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "A language model is a probabilistic model representing the probability of a document, denoted by $p(x_1, \\cdots, x_T)$. This probability distribution is very complex because its support size is $V^T$—exponential in the length of the document. Instead of modeling the distribution of a document itself, we can apply the chain rule of conditional probability to decompose it as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(x_1, \\cdots, x_T) = p(x_1) p(x_2|x_1) \\cdots p(x_T|x_1, \\cdots, x_{T-1}).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Mathematical Challenge:**\n",
    "- **Direct modeling**: Would require estimating $V^T$ parameters\n",
    "- **Exponential growth**: Parameters grow exponentially with sequence length\n",
    "- **Intractability**: Impossible to estimate for realistic document lengths\n",
    "- **Solution**: Chain rule decomposition breaks the problem into manageable pieces\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the support size of each of the conditional probability $p(x_t|x_1, \\cdots, x_{t-1})$ is $V$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Chain Rule Advantage:**\n",
    "- **Linear growth**: Only $T \\times V$ parameters needed\n",
    "- **Conditional structure**: Each prediction depends only on previous words\n",
    "- **Tractable**: Much more manageable computational complexity\n",
    "- **Natural**: Matches how humans process language sequentially\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Understanding the Chain Rule Decomposition\n",
    "\n",
    "The chain rule decomposition is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to break down complex joint distributions into simpler conditional distributions. Here's why this is crucial for language modeling:\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Problem with Direct Modeling:**\n",
    "- The vocabulary size $V$ is typically 50,000-100,000 words\n",
    "- Document length $T$ can be hundreds or thousands of words\n",
    "- Direct modeling would require estimating $V^T$ parameters\n",
    "- For a vocabulary of 50,000 and document length of 100, this is $50,000^{100}$ parameters!\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Exponential Explosion Analogy:**\n",
    "- **Vocabulary**: Like having 50,000 different building blocks\n",
    "- **Document**: Like building a structure with 100 blocks\n",
    "- **Direct modeling**: Like trying to memorize every possible structure\n",
    "- **Chain rule**: Like learning rules for adding one block at a time\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Solution with Chain Rule:**\n",
    "- Each conditional probability $p(x_t|x_1, \\cdots, x_{t-1})$ only needs $V$ parameters\n",
    "- Total parameters needed: $T \\times V$ (much more manageable)\n",
    "- Each prediction depends only on the previous words in the sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Sequential Learning Intuition:**\n",
    "- **Step 1**: Learn to predict the first word $p(x_1)$\n",
    "- **Step 2**: Learn to predict the second word given the first $p(x_2|x_1)$\n",
    "- **Step 3**: Learn to predict the third word given the first two $p(x_3|x_1, x_2)$\n",
    "- **Continue**: Build up understanding word by word\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "Consider the sentence \"The cat sat on the mat\":\n",
    "- $p(\\text{The})$: Probability of starting with \"The\"\n",
    "- $p(\\text{cat}|\\text{The})$: Probability of \"cat\" given \"The\"\n",
    "- $p(\\text{sat}|\\text{The cat})$: Probability of \"sat\" given \"The cat\"\n",
    "- And so on...\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Context Building Process:**\n",
    "- **\"The\"**: No context, just word frequency\n",
    "- **\"The cat\"**: Context helps predict animal-related words\n",
    "- **\"The cat sat\"**: Context suggests action words\n",
    "- **\"The cat sat on\"**: Context suggests spatial relationships\n",
    "- **\"The cat sat on the\"**: Context suggests objects or surfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameterizing the Language Model\n",
    "\n",
    "We will model the conditional probability $p(x_t|x_1, \\cdots, x_{t-1})$ as a function of $x_1, \\ldots, x_{t-1}$ parameterized by some parameter $\\theta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Parameterization Challenge:**\n",
    "- **Input**: Sequence of discrete word indices\n",
    "- **Output**: Probability distribution over vocabulary\n",
    "- **Function**: Must capture complex language patterns\n",
    "- **Learning**: Must be differentiable for gradient-based optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "A parameterized model takes in numerical inputs and therefore we first introduce embeddings or representations for the words. Let $e_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ be the embedding of the word $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\cdots, V\\}$. We call $[e_1, \\cdots, e_V] \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times V}$ the embedding matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Word Embeddings: From Discrete to Continuous\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Challenge:**\n",
    "- Words are discrete symbols (e.g., \"cat\", \"dog\", \"house\")\n",
    "- Neural networks work with continuous numerical inputs\n",
    "- We need a way to convert words to numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Discrete vs. Continuous Problem:**\n",
    "- **Discrete words**: \"cat\", \"dog\", \"house\" - no natural numerical relationship\n",
    "- **Neural networks**: Expect continuous, differentiable inputs\n",
    "- **Solution**: Map each word to a continuous vector (embedding)\n",
    "- **Learning**: Embeddings are learned to capture semantic relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Solution:**\n",
    "- Each word is assigned a unique integer ID (e.g., \"cat\" = 42, \"dog\" = 17)\n",
    "- Each word ID is mapped to a continuous vector (embedding)\n",
    "- These embeddings are learned during training\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Word-to-Vector Process:**\n",
    "1. **Vocabulary creation**: Assign unique IDs to all words\n",
    "2. **Embedding initialization**: Start with random vectors\n",
    "3. **Learning**: Update embeddings based on word usage patterns\n",
    "4. **Semantic capture**: Similar words get similar embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "**Properties of Word Embeddings:**\n",
    "- **Dimensionality**: Typically 256-1024 dimensions\n",
    "- **Semantic Similarity**: Similar words have similar embeddings\n",
    "- **Learnable**: Embeddings are updated during training to capture word relationships\n",
    "- **Context-independent**: Each word has a fixed embedding (in basic models)\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Semantic Space Analogy:**\n",
    "- **Words**: Like points in a high-dimensional space\n",
    "- **Similar words**: Like points that are close together\n",
    "- **Related concepts**: Like clusters of nearby points\n",
    "- **Semantic relationships**: Like geometric relationships between points\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Vocabulary: [\"the\", \"cat\", \"sat\", \"on\", \"mat\"]\n",
    "Word IDs: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "Embeddings: \n",
    "  e_1 (the) = [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ...]\n",
    "  e_2 (cat) = [0.4, 0.1, 0.8, ...]\n",
    "  e_3 (sat) = [0.2, 0.9, 0.1, ...]\n",
    "  ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Embedding Learning Process:**\n",
    "- **Initialization**: Random vectors for each word\n",
    "- **Context learning**: Words that appear in similar contexts get similar embeddings\n",
    "- **Semantic capture**: \"cat\" and \"dog\" become similar because they appear in similar contexts\n",
    "- **Relationship learning**: \"king\" - \"man\" + \"woman\" ≈ \"queen\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Transformer Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The most commonly used model is the Transformer [Vaswani et al., 2017]. In this subsection, we will introduce the input-output interface of a Transformer, but treat the intermediate computation in the Transformer as a blackbox. We will cover more of the transformer architecture in [section 12](../12_llm/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Big Picture: Why Transformers Matter\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Sequential Processing Problem:**\n",
    "Traditional neural networks (RNNs, LSTMs) process text word by word sequentially. This creates several problems:\n",
    "- **Slow training**: Can't parallelize across sequence length\n",
    "- **Memory issues**: Hard to handle long sequences\n",
    "- **Gradient problems**: Information can get lost over long distances\n",
    "- **Limited context**: Hard to capture long-range dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Transformer Solution:**\n",
    "- **Parallel processing**: Can process entire sequences at once\n",
    "- **Attention mechanism**: Can directly attend to any position in the sequence\n",
    "- **Long-range dependencies**: Can capture relationships across long distances\n",
    "- **Scalable**: Performance improves with more data and larger models\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transformer Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The Transformer is a neural network architecture that revolutionized natural language processing. Unlike previous models that processed sequences sequentially (like RNNs), Transformers can process entire sequences in parallel, making them much faster to train and more effective at capturing long-range dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Parallel Processing Advantage:**\n",
    "- **RNNs**: Must process word 1, then word 2, then word 3...\n",
    "- **Transformers**: Can process all words simultaneously\n",
    "- **Speed**: Much faster training and inference\n",
    "- **Efficiency**: Better utilization of modern hardware (GPUs)\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Attention Revolution:**\n",
    "- **Traditional models**: Each word only sees previous words\n",
    "- **Transformers**: Each word can attend to any other word\n",
    "- **Context**: Full context available for every prediction\n",
    "- **Relationships**: Can capture complex relationships between distant words\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Components of the Transformer\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input Embeddings**: Convert word tokens to continuous vectors\n",
    "2. **Positional Encodings**: Add information about word positions in the sequence\n",
    "3. **Multi-Head Self-Attention**: Allow words to attend to all other words in the sequence\n",
    "4. **Feed-Forward Networks**: Process each position independently\n",
    "5. **Layer Normalization**: Stabilize training\n",
    "6. **Residual Connections**: Help with gradient flow\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Transformer Architecture Analogy:**\n",
    "- **Input Embeddings**: Like translating words into a common language\n",
    "- **Positional Encodings**: Like adding timestamps to know word order\n",
    "- **Self-Attention**: Like having a spotlight that can focus on any word\n",
    "- **Feed-Forward**: Like processing each word's meaning independently\n",
    "- **Layer Normalization**: Like keeping the signal strength consistent\n",
    "- **Residual Connections**: Like having shortcuts to preserve information\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input-Output Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown in Figure 14.1, given a document $(x_1, \\cdots, x_T)$, we first translate the sequence of discrete variables into a sequence of corresponding word embeddings ($e_{x_1}, \\cdots, e_{x_T}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./img/transformer_output.png\" width=\"400px\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Figure 14.1 (description):** The inputs to the Transformer are the embeddings $e_{x_0}, e_{x_1}, \\ldots, e_{x_T}$ corresponding to the tokens $x_0, x_1, \\ldots, x_T$. The Transformer $f_\\theta(x)$ outputs a sequence of vectors $u_1, u_2, \\ldots, u_{T+1}$, each of which is used to predict the next token in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Input Processing Pipeline:**\n",
    "1. **Word tokens**: Discrete word IDs (e.g., [1, 42, 17, 8, 23])\n",
    "2. **Word embeddings**: Convert to continuous vectors\n",
    "3. **Positional encoding**: Add position information\n",
    "4. **Transformer processing**: Apply attention and feed-forward layers\n",
    "5. **Output logits**: Continuous vectors for next-word prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "We also introduce a fixed special token $x_0 = \\perp$ in the vocabulary with corresponding embedding $e_{x_0}$ to mark the beginning of a document. Then, the word embeddings are passed into a Transformer model, which takes in a sequence of vectors ($e_{x_0}, e_{x_1}, \\cdots, e_{x_T}$) and outputs a sequence of vectors ($u_1, u_2, \\cdots, u_{T+1}$), where $u_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^V$ will be interpreted as the logits for the probability distribution of the next word.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Understanding the Special Token\n",
    "\n",
    "The special token $\\perp$ (often called `<BOS>` for \"beginning of sequence\") serves several important purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sequence Start Marker**: Indicates the beginning of a new sequence\n",
    "2. **Context for First Word**: Provides context for predicting the first actual word\n",
    "3. **Consistent Input Length**: Ensures all sequences have the same structure\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Special Token Analogy:**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Like a \"start\" button that tells the model a new sequence is beginning\n",
    "- **Context**: Like having a blank slate before the first word\n",
    "- **Consistency**: Like always having the same starting point for every sequence\n",
    "- **Prediction**: Like having a reference point for predicting the first word\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why We Need It:**\n",
    "- **First word prediction**: Without it, the model has no context for predicting the first word\n",
    "- **Sequence boundaries**: Helps the model know when one sequence ends and another begins\n",
    "- **Training consistency**: Ensures all sequences have the same structure\n",
    "- **Generation**: Provides a starting point for text generation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Autoregressive Property\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we use the autoregressive version of the Transformer, which by design ensures $u_t$ only depends on $x_1, \\cdots, x_{t-1}$ (note that this property does not hold in masked language models [Devlin et al., 2019] where the losses are also different).\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is Autoregressive?**\n",
    "- Each output depends only on previous inputs\n",
    "- No information from future tokens is used\n",
    "- This is crucial for language generation tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Autoregressive Intuition:**\n",
    "- **Causal structure**: Like predicting the next word in a sentence\n",
    "- **No cheating**: Can't use information from words that haven't been written yet\n",
    "- **Generation**: Perfect for text generation (predict one word at a time)\n",
    "- **Training**: Each position predicts the next word given previous words\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "For the sequence \"The cat sat\":\n",
    "- $u_1$ depends on $x_0$ (special token) only\n",
    "- $u_2$ depends on $x_0, x_1$ (\"The\")\n",
    "- $u_3$ depends on $x_0, x_1, x_2$ (\"The cat\")\n",
    "- $u_4$ depends on $x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3$ (\"The cat sat\")\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Prediction Process:**\n",
    "- **Position 1**: Predict word after start token\n",
    "- **Position 2**: Predict word after \"The\"\n",
    "- **Position 3**: Predict word after \"The cat\"\n",
    "- **Position 4**: Predict word after \"The cat sat\"\n",
    "\n",
    "We view the whole mapping from $x$'s to $u$'s as a blackbox in this subsection and call it a Transformer, denoted it by $f_\\theta$, where $\\theta$ include both the parameters in the Transformer and the input embeddings.

    "## The Transformer Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The most commonly used model is the Transformer [Vaswani et al., 2017]. In this subsection, we will introduce the input-output interface of a Transformer, but treat the intermediate computation in the Transformer as a blackbox. We will cover more of the transformer architecture in [section 12](../12_llm/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transformer Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The Transformer is a neural network architecture that revolutionized natural language processing. Unlike previous models that processed sequences sequentially (like RNNs), Transformers can process entire sequences in parallel, making them much faster to train and more effective at capturing long-range dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Components of the Transformer\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input Embeddings**: Convert word tokens to continuous vectors\n",
    "2. **Positional Encodings**: Add information about word positions in the sequence\n",
    "3. **Multi-Head Self-Attention**: Allow words to attend to all other words in the sequence\n",
    "4. **Feed-Forward Networks**: Process each position independently\n",
    "5. **Layer Normalization**: Stabilize training\n",
    "6. **Residual Connections**: Help with gradient flow\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input-Output Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown in Figure 14.1, given a document $(x_1, \\cdots, x_T)$, we first translate the sequence of discrete variables into a sequence of corresponding word embeddings ($e_{x_1}, \\cdots, e_{x_T}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./img/transformer_output.png\" width=\"400px\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Figure 14.1 (description):** The inputs to the Transformer are the embeddings $e_{x_0}, e_{x_1}, \\ldots, e_{x_T}$ corresponding to the tokens $x_0, x_1, \\ldots, x_T$. The Transformer $f_\\theta(x)$ outputs a sequence of vectors $u_1, u_2, \\ldots, u_{T+1}$, each of which is used to predict the next token in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also introduce a fixed special token $x_0 = \\perp$ in the vocabulary with corresponding embedding $e_{x_0}$ to mark the beginning of a document. Then, the word embeddings are passed into a Transformer model, which takes in a sequence of vectors ($e_{x_0}, e_{x_1}, \\cdots, e_{x_T}$) and outputs a sequence of vectors ($u_1, u_2, \\cdots, u_{T+1}$), where $u_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^V$ will be interpreted as the logits for the probability distribution of the next word.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Understanding the Special Token\n",
    "\n",
    "The special token $\\perp$ (often called `<BOS>` for \"beginning of sequence\") serves several important purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sequence Start Marker**: Indicates the beginning of a new sequence\n",
    "2. **Context for First Word**: Provides context for predicting the first actual word\n",
    "3. **Consistent Input Length**: Ensures all sequences have the same structure\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Autoregressive Property\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we use the autoregressive version of the Transformer, which by design ensures $u_t$ only depends on $x_1, \\cdots, x_{t-1}$ (note that this property does not hold in masked language models [Devlin et al., 2019] where the losses are also different).\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is Autoregressive?**\n",
    "- Each output depends only on previous inputs\n",
    "- No information from future tokens is used\n",
    "- This is crucial for language generation tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "For the sequence \"The cat sat\":\n",
    "- $u_1$ depends on $x_0$ (special token) only\n",
    "- $u_2$ depends on $x_0, x_1$ (\"The\")\n",
    "- $u_3$ depends on $x_0, x_1, x_2$ (\"The cat\")\n",
    "- $u_4$ depends on $x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3$ (\"The cat sat\")\n",
    "\n",
    "We view the whole mapping from $x$'s to $u$'s as a blackbox in this subsection and call it a Transformer, denoted it by $f_\\theta$, where $\\theta$ include both the parameters in the Transformer and the input embeddings. We write $u_t = f_\\theta(x_0, x_1, \\ldots, x_{t-1})$ where $f_\\theta$ denotes the mapping from the input to the outputs.\n",

    "\n",
    "**The Amplification Effect:**\n",

    "- **Small logits**: Stay small after exponentiation\n",
    "- **Result**: Sharpens the distribution, making confident predictions more confident\n",

    "\n",
    "For language models, there are many ways to adapt a pretrained model to downstream tasks. In this notes, we discuss three of them: finetuning, zero-shot learning, and in-context learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Big Picture: Adaptation Methods for Language Models\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Adaptation Challenge:**\n",
    "Once we have a pretrained language model, we need to use it for specific tasks. Different tasks require different adaptation strategies, depending on the amount of labeled data available and the specific requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Adaptation Spectrum:**\n",
    "- **Finetuning**: Lots of labeled data, best performance\n",
    "- **In-context learning**: Few labeled examples, good performance\n",
    "- **Zero-shot learning**: No labeled data, variable performance\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Key Insight:**\n",
    "Language models can adapt to new tasks without traditional training by using their general language understanding and the structure of the task itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finetuning\n",
    "\n",
    "**Finetuning** is not very common for the autoregressive language models that we introduced in Section 14.3 but much more common for other variants such as masked language models which has similar input-output interfaces but are pretrained differently [Devlin et al., 2019]. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finetuning means taking a model that has already learned a lot from a huge dataset (pretraining), and then continuing to train it on a smaller, task-specific dataset. Think of it like a student who has read many books (pretraining) and then studies specifically for a test (finetuning). The model adapts its knowledge to do well on the new task.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Finetuning Analogy:**\n",
    "- **Pretraining**: Like getting a general education (reading many books)\n",
    "- **Finetuning**: Like studying for a specific exam (focused learning)\n",
    "- **Adaptation**: Like using general knowledge to learn specific skills\n",
    "- **Specialization**: Like becoming an expert in a particular area\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Finetuning Process:**\n",
    "1. **Start with pretrained model**: Model already knows general language patterns\n",
    "2. **Add task-specific data**: Small dataset for the specific task\n",
    "3. **Continue training**: Update model parameters on task data\n",
    "4. **Task specialization**: Model becomes good at the specific task\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mathematical Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "The finetuning method is the same as introduced generally in Section 14.1—the only question is how we define the prediction task with an additional linear head. One option is to treat $c_{T+1} = \\phi_\\theta(x_1, \\cdots, x_T)$ as the representation and use $w^\\top c_{T+1} = w^\\top \\phi_\\theta(x_1, \\cdots, x_T)$ to predict the task label. As described in Section 14.1, we initialize $\\theta$ to the pretrained model $\\hat{\\theta}$ and then optimize both $w$ and $\\theta$.\n",

    "- **Parameter initialization**: $\\theta \\leftarrow \\hat{\\theta}$ (pretrained weights)\n",
    "- **Joint optimization**: Update both $w$ and $\\theta$\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Representation Learning:**\n",
    "- **$c_{T+1}$**: Final representation from the language model\n",
    "- **$w$**: Task-specific weights to be learned\n",
    "- **$y$**: Task prediction (classification, regression, etc.)\n",
    "- **Learning**: Both representation and task weights are updated\n",

    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "- **Best Performance**: Can achieve highest accuracy on the target task\n",
    "- **Task-Specific Adaptation**: Model can learn task-specific patterns\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: Can adapt to any task format\n",
    "- **Optimization**: Can optimize for task-specific metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages:**\n",
    "- **Requires Labeled Data**: Needs significant amount of task-specific data\n",
    "- **Computationally Expensive**: Requires training the entire model\n",
    "- **Risk of Catastrophic Forgetting**: May lose general knowledge\n",
    "- **Task-Specific**: Need separate model for each task\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Catastrophic Forgetting Problem:**\n",
    "- **What happens**: Model forgets general knowledge while learning specific task\n",
    "- **Why it happens**: Parameters optimized for specific task may not preserve general knowledge\n",
    "- **Mitigation**: Use smaller learning rates, regularization, or parameter-efficient methods\n",
    "- **Trade-off**: Task performance vs. general knowledge preservation\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Use:**\n",
    "- You have a large labeled dataset for your specific task\n",
    "- You want the best possible performance\n",
    "- You have sufficient computational resources\n",
    "- The task is very different from pretraining\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Why does this work?** The pretrained model already knows a lot about language, so it only needs to \"tune\" itself to the specifics of the new task. This is much faster and requires less data than training from scratch.\n",

    "### Zero-shot Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "**Zero-shot** adaptation or zero-shot learning is the setting where there is no input-output pairs from the downstream tasks. For language problems tasks, typically the task is formatted as a question or a cloze test form via natural language. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The key insight is that we can format many tasks as natural language questions or prompts. The model then generates text that answers the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we can format an example as a question:\n",
    "\n",
    "$x_{\\text{task}} = (x_{\\text{task},1}, \\cdots, x_{\\text{task},R}) = \\text{\"Is the speed of light a universal constant?\"}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we compute the most likely next word predicted by the language model given this question, that is, computing $\\text{argmax}_{x_{T+1}} p(x_{T+1} \\mid x_{\\text{task},1}, \\cdots, x_{\\text{task},R})$. In this case, if the most likely next word $x_{T+1}$ is \"No\", then we solve the task. (The speed of light is only a constant in vacuum.)\n",

    "- **Natural language**: Convert task into question or instruction\n",
    "- **Clear instructions**: Make it obvious what the model should do\n",
