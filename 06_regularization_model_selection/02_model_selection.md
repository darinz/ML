## 9.3 Model Selection via Cross Validation

### What is Model Selection?

Selecting the right model is one of the most important—and challenging—tasks in machine learning. The "model" could mean the type of algorithm (e.g., linear regression, SVM, neural network), or it could mean the specific settings or complexity of a model (e.g., the degree of a polynomial, the number of layers in a neural network, or the regularization strength in ridge regression).

**The Fundamental Challenge:**
- **Too Simple**: Model may not capture the underlying patterns in the data (high bias, underfitting)
- **Too Complex**: Model may fit the noise in the training data rather than the true signal (high variance, overfitting)
- **The Goal**: Find the "sweet spot" between these two extremes

### Why is Model Selection Important?

**Real-World Analogy:**
Imagine you're choosing a tool for a job. A simple screwdriver might not be powerful enough for complex tasks, while a Swiss Army knife with 50 tools might be overkill and confusing. You need the right tool for the job—not too simple, not too complex.

**Example:**  
Suppose you're fitting a curve to data points. If you use a straight line (degree 1 polynomial), it might miss important bends in the data. If you use a degree 10 polynomial, it might wiggle wildly to pass through every point, capturing noise rather than the true trend.

**Key Question:**  
How do we choose the best model or the best complexity for our data, *without* peeking at the test set (which would give us an overly optimistic estimate of performance)?

## From Regularization Techniques to Model Selection Strategies

We've now explored **regularization** - the fundamental techniques that help prevent overfitting by adding constraints or penalties to the learning process. We've seen how L1, L2, and Elastic Net regularization work, how implicit regularization affects optimization, and how these techniques help us find the sweet spot between underfitting and overfitting.

However, while regularization provides the tools to control model complexity, we still need systematic methods to **choose the right model** and **estimate its performance** reliably. Regularization tells us how to constrain a model, but it doesn't tell us which model to use or how to compare different options.

This motivates our exploration of **model selection** - the systematic process of choosing among different models, model complexities, and hyperparameters. We'll see how cross-validation provides reliable performance estimates, how Bayesian methods incorporate uncertainty and prior knowledge, and how to avoid common pitfalls in model selection.

The transition from regularization to model selection represents the bridge from technique to strategy - taking our knowledge of how to control model complexity and turning it into a systematic approach for building optimal models.

In this section, we'll explore cross-validation techniques, Bayesian approaches, and practical guidelines for selecting the best model for any given problem.

## The Model Selection Problem

### Formal Definition

Suppose we are trying to select among several different models for a learning problem. For instance, we might be using a polynomial regression model $`h_\theta(x) = g(\theta_0 + \theta_1 x + \theta_2 x^2 + \cdots + \theta_k x^k)`$, and wish to decide if $`k`$ should be $`0, 1, \ldots, 10`$. How can we automatically select a model that represents a good tradeoff between the twin evils of bias and variance?

**Other Examples:**
- Choosing the bandwidth parameter $`\tau`$ for locally weighted regression
- Selecting the parameter $`C`$ for $`\ell_1`$-regularized SVM
- Deciding between linear regression, polynomial regression, or neural networks
- Choosing the number of hidden layers in a neural network

### The Model Space

For the sake of concreteness, in these notes we assume we have some finite set of models $`\mathcal{M} = \{M_1, \ldots, M_d\}`$ that we're trying to select among. For instance, in our first example above, the model $`M_i`$ would be an $`i`$-th degree polynomial regression model.

**Generalization to Infinite Model Spaces:**
If we are trying to choose from an infinite set of models, say corresponding to the possible values of the bandwidth $`\tau \in \mathbb{R}^+`$, we may discretize $`\tau`$ and consider only a finite number of possible values for it. More generally, most of the algorithms described here can all be viewed as performing optimization search in the space of models, and we can perform this search over infinite model classes as well.

### The Bias-Variance Tradeoff

**Understanding the Tradeoff:**
- **Bias**: How much the model's predictions differ from the true values on average
- **Variance**: How much the model's predictions vary when trained on different datasets
- **Total Error**: $`\text{Total Error} = \text{Bias}^2 + \text{Variance} + \text{Irreducible Error}`$

**Visual Analogy:**
Think of bias and variance like trying to hit a target with darts:
- **High Bias, Low Variance**: Consistently hitting the same wrong spot
- **Low Bias, High Variance**: Hitting all around the target but rarely on it
- **Low Bias, Low Variance**: Consistently hitting the target

---

## The Pitfall of Naive Model Selection

### The Wrong Way: Training Error

A tempting but flawed approach is to simply pick the model that fits the training data best (i.e., has the lowest training error). However, this almost always leads to overfitting: the most complex model will always fit the training data best, but may perform poorly on new, unseen data.

**Why This Fails:**
- Training error is an optimistic estimate of true performance
- More complex models can always fit the training data better
- This doesn't tell us how well the model will generalize

**Analogy:**  
Imagine memorizing answers to practice exam questions. You'll ace the practice test, but if the real exam has different questions, you might struggle. Similarly, a model that "memorizes" the training data may not generalize well.

**Mathematical Explanation:**
The training error $`\hat{\varepsilon}_{\text{train}}(h)`$ is a biased estimate of the true error $`\varepsilon(h)`$:
$`\mathbb{E}[\hat{\varepsilon}_{\text{train}}(h)] \leq \varepsilon(h)`$

The inequality becomes more severe as model complexity increases.

---

## Cross Validation: The Gold Standard

### What is Cross-Validation?

Cross validation is a family of techniques that help us estimate how well a model will perform on new data, *without* using the test set. The core idea is to simulate the process of seeing new data by holding out part of the training data, training the model on the rest, and evaluating it on the held-out part.

**The Core Principle:**
- Split the data into training and validation sets
- Train on one part, evaluate on the other
- This gives us an unbiased estimate of generalization performance

### Hold-out Cross Validation (Simple Cross Validation)

**Algorithm:**
1. **Step 1:** Randomly split your data into a training set and a validation (hold-out) set. A common split is 70% training, 30% validation, but this can vary.
2. **Step 2:** Train each candidate model on the training set.
3. **Step 3:** Evaluate each model on the validation set, and pick the one with the lowest validation error.

**Why does this work?**  
The validation set acts as a "proxy" for new, unseen data. By evaluating on data the model hasn't seen, we get a better estimate of its true generalization ability.

**Mathematical Formulation:**
For each model $`M_i`$, we compute:
$`\hat{\varepsilon}_{\text{val}}(h_i) = \frac{1}{|S_{\text{val}}|} \sum_{(x,y) \in S_{\text{val}}} L(h_i(x), y)`$

Then select: $`M^* = \arg\min_i \hat{\varepsilon}_{\text{val}}(h_i)`$

**Practical Considerations:**
- **Large datasets**: You can afford to set aside a substantial validation set
- **Small datasets**: You may need more efficient use of data—this is where k-fold cross validation comes in
- **Stratification**: For classification, ensure the validation set has similar class proportions

### Validation Set Size Guidelines

By testing/validating on a set of examples $`S_{\text{cv}}`$ that the models were not trained on, we obtain a better estimate of each hypothesis $`h_i`$'s true generalization/test error. Thus, this approach is essentially picking the model with the smallest estimated generalization/test error.

**Size Guidelines:**
- **Typical split**: 70% training, 30% validation
- **Large datasets**: Can use smaller validation fractions (e.g., 10-20%)
- **Small datasets**: May need larger validation fractions (e.g., 40-50%)

**Examples:**
- **Small dataset (n=100)**: 70% training, 30% validation
- **Medium dataset (n=10,000)**: 80% training, 20% validation  
- **Large dataset (n=1,000,000)**: 90% training, 10% validation

**ImageNet Example:**
For the ImageNet dataset that has about 1M training images, the validation set is sometimes set to be 50K images, which is only about 5% of the total examples.

### Optional Retraining Step

Optionally, step 3 in the algorithm may also be replaced with selecting the model $`M_i`$ according to $`\arg\min_i \hat{\varepsilon}_{S_{\text{cv}}}(h_i)`$, and then retraining $`M_i`$ on the entire training set $`S`$.

**When to retrain:**
- ✅ **Good idea**: Most learning algorithms benefit from more data
- ❌ **Avoid**: For algorithms sensitive to initialization or data perturbations

**Why retrain?**
- The model selected was trained on only 70% of the data
- Retraining on all data typically improves performance
- Final model should use all available training data

### Limitations of Hold-out Validation

The disadvantage of using hold out cross validation is that it "wastes" about 30% of the data. Even if we were to take the optional step of retraining the model on the entire training set, it's still as if we're trying to find a good model for a learning problem in which we had $`0.7n`$ training examples, rather than $`n`$ training examples, since we're testing models that were trained on only $`0.7n`$ examples each time.

**When this matters:**
- **Small datasets**: Losing 30% of data can significantly hurt performance
- **Expensive data**: When data collection is costly
- **Rare events**: When positive examples are scarce

**Solution**: Use k-fold cross validation for more efficient data usage.

---

### k-Fold Cross Validation

#### Motivation

Hold-out validation "wastes" some data, since the model never sees the validation set during training. k-fold cross validation addresses this by rotating the validation set.

**Key Insight:**
Every data point gets to be in the validation set exactly once, and in the training set $`k-1`$ times.

#### How it Works

**Algorithm:**
1. Split the data into $`k`$ equal-sized "folds"
2. For each fold $`i = 1, 2, \ldots, k`$:
   - Use fold $`i`$ as the validation set
   - Use the remaining $`k-1`$ folds as the training set
   - Train the model and evaluate on the validation fold
   - Record the validation error $`\hat{\varepsilon}_i`$
3. Average the validation errors: $`\hat{\varepsilon}_{\text{CV}} = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=1}^k \hat{\varepsilon}_i`$

**Mathematical Formulation:**
For each model $`M_j`$ and fold $`i`$:
$`\hat{\varepsilon}_i^{(j)} = \frac{1}{|S_i|} \sum_{(x,y) \in S_i} L(h_j^{(i)}(x), y)`$

Where $`h_j^{(i)}`$ is model $`M_j`$ trained on all folds except $`i`$.

**Final selection:**
$`M^* = \arg\min_j \frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=1}^k \hat{\varepsilon}_i^{(j)}`$

#### Common Choices and Trade-offs

**Common choices:**  
$`k = 10`$ is popular, but for very small datasets, $`k = n`$ (leave-one-out cross validation) is sometimes used.

**Trade-offs:**  
- **Larger $`k`$**: Less bias (since almost all data is used for training each time), but more computational cost (since you train $`k`$ times)
- **Smaller $`k`$**: More bias but faster computation
- **Leave-one-out**: Unbiased but can be very slow for large datasets

**Guidelines:**
- **$`k = 5`**: Quick and dirty, good for initial exploration
- **$`k = 10`**: Standard choice, good balance of bias and variance
- **$`k = n`** (LOOCV): When data is very scarce

**Analogy:**  
Think of k-fold as a "round robin tournament" where every data point gets a chance to be in the validation set.

#### Computational Complexity

A typical choice for the number of folds to use here would be $`k = 10`$. While the fraction of data held out each time is now $`1/k`$—much smaller than before—this procedure may also be more computationally expensive than hold-out cross validation, since we now need to train each model $`k`$ times.

**Complexity Analysis:**
- **Hold-out**: Train each model once
- **k-fold**: Train each model $`k`$ times
- **Total cost**: $`k \times \text{number of models} \times \text{training time per model}`$

#### Leave-One-Out Cross Validation (LOOCV)

While $`k = 10`$ is a commonly used choice, in problems in which data is really scarce, sometimes we will use the extreme choice of $`k = n`$ in order to leave out as little data as possible each time. In this setting, we would repeatedly train on all but one of the training examples in $`S`$, and test on that held-out example. The resulting $`n`$ errors are then averaged together to obtain our estimate of the generalization error of a model.

**When to use LOOCV:**
- **Very small datasets** (n < 50)
- **Expensive data collection**
- **When you need the most unbiased estimate possible**

**Advantages:**
- Most unbiased estimate of generalization error
- Uses almost all data for training each time
- No randomness in the split

**Disadvantages:**
- Computationally expensive ($`n`$ training runs)
- High variance in the estimate
- May not be practical for large datasets

### Cross Validation for Model Evaluation

Cross validation isn't just for model selection—it's also a powerful tool for evaluating a single model's performance, especially when you want to report results in a paper or compare algorithms fairly.

**Use Cases:**
- **Research papers**: Report cross-validation performance
- **Algorithm comparison**: Fair comparison between methods
- **Performance estimation**: Get confidence intervals for model performance

**Practical Tips:**
- Always use a validation set or cross-validation for model selection—never the test set!
- For small datasets, prefer k-fold or leave-one-out cross validation
- For large datasets, a simple hold-out set is often sufficient and computationally efficient
- Use stratified sampling for classification problems
- Fix random seeds for reproducibility

## 9.4 Bayesian Statistics and Regularization

### Introduction to Bayesian Methods

So far, we've discussed how to select models and estimate their performance. But how do we *fit* the parameters of a model? And how do we avoid overfitting at the parameter level? This is where statistical estimation and regularization come in.

**The Key Question:**
How do we estimate model parameters in a way that prevents overfitting and incorporates our prior knowledge?

**Two Main Approaches:**
1. **Frequentist**: Treat parameters as fixed but unknown
2. **Bayesian**: Treat parameters as random variables with distributions

---

## Frequentist vs Bayesian Approaches

### Frequentist View: Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)

In the frequentist approach, we treat the model parameters $`\theta`$ as fixed but unknown quantities. Our goal is to find the value of $`\theta`$ that makes the observed data most probable.

**The MLE Principle:**
```math
\theta_{\text{MLE}} = \arg\max_{\theta} \prod_{i=1}^n p(y^{(i)}|x^{(i)}; \theta)
```

**Breaking it down:**
- $`p(y^{(i)}|x^{(i)}; \theta)`$ is the likelihood of observing $`y^{(i)}`$ given $`x^{(i)}`$ and parameters $`\theta`$
- We multiply the likelihoods for all data points (assuming independence)
- We pick the $`\theta`$ that maximizes this product

**Intuition:**  
MLE finds the parameters that "explain" the data best, according to our model.

**Example - Linear Regression:**
For linear regression with Gaussian noise, the likelihood is:
$`p(y^{(i)}|x^{(i)}; \theta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} \exp\left(-\frac{(y^{(i)} - \theta^T x^{(i)})^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)`$

Taking the log and maximizing gives us the familiar least squares solution.

**Properties of MLE:**
- ✅ **Consistent**: Converges to true parameters as $`n \to \infty`$
- ✅ **Efficient**: Has the smallest variance among unbiased estimators
- ❌ **No regularization**: Can overfit with small datasets
- ❌ **No uncertainty quantification**: Doesn't tell us how confident we are

---

## Bayesian View: Priors, Posteriors, and Prediction

### The Bayesian Framework

In the Bayesian approach, we treat $`\theta`$ as a *random variable* with its own probability distribution, reflecting our uncertainty about its true value.

**Key Components:**
- **Prior $`p(\theta)`$:** What we believe about $`\theta`$ before seeing any data
- **Likelihood $`p(y|x, \theta)`$:** How likely the data is, given $`\theta`$
- **Posterior $`p(\theta|S)`$:** What we believe about $`\theta`$ after seeing the data $`S`$

### Bayes' Rule for Parameters

**The Fundamental Equation:**
```math
p(\theta|S) = \frac{p(S|\theta)p(\theta)}{p(S)} = \frac{\left(\prod_{i=1}^n p(y^{(i)}|x^{(i)}, \theta)\right)p(\theta)}{\int_{\theta} \left(\prod_{i=1}^n p(y^{(i)}|x^{(i)}, \theta)p(\theta)\right) d\theta}
```

**Understanding Each Term:**
1. **$`p(S|\theta)`$**: The likelihood of the data given the parameters
2. **$`p(\theta)`$**: The prior distribution over parameters
3. **$`p(S)`$**: The marginal likelihood (normalizing constant)
4. **$`p(\theta|S)`$**: The posterior distribution over parameters

**The Denominator:**
The denominator ensures the posterior is a valid probability distribution (integrates to 1). It's often the most challenging part to compute.

### Bayesian Prediction

**Fully Bayesian Prediction:**  
To predict for a new $`x`$, we average over all possible $`\theta`$ weighted by their posterior probability:

```math
p(y|x, S) = \int_{\theta} p(y|x, \theta)p(\theta|S)d\theta
```

This is called "fully Bayesian" prediction because we're using the entire posterior distribution.

**Expected Value Prediction:**  
If $`y`$ is continuous, we might want the expected value:

```math
\mathbb{E}[y|x, S] = \int_{y} y p(y|x, S) dy
```

**Example - Bayesian Linear Regression:**
For linear regression with Gaussian prior and likelihood, the posterior is also Gaussian, and predictions have both a mean and variance (uncertainty).

### Choosing the Likelihood Function

In the equation above, $`p(y^{(i)}|x^{(i)}, \theta)`$ comes from whatever model you're using for your learning problem. For example, if you are using Bayesian logistic regression, then you might choose:

$`p(y^{(i)}|x^{(i)}, \theta) = h_\theta(x^{(i)})^{y^{(i)}}(1-h_\theta(x^{(i)}))^{(1-y^{(i)})}`$

Where $`h_\theta(x) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-\theta^T x)}`$ is the sigmoid function.

---

## MAP Estimation and Regularization

### The MAP Approximation

Computing the full posterior is often intractable, so we approximate it by its mode—the most probable value, called the **maximum a posteriori (MAP)** estimate:

```math
\theta_{\text{MAP}} = \arg\max_{\theta} \prod_{i=1}^n p(y^{(i)}|x^{(i)}, \theta)p(\theta)
```

**Key Insight:**
This is like MLE, but with an extra term for the prior $`p(\theta)`$.

### Connection to Regularization

**Gaussian Prior → L2 Regularization:**
If the prior is Gaussian, $`\theta \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \tau^2 I)`$, MAP estimation is equivalent to adding L2 regularization (ridge regression) in linear models.

**Derivation:**
1. Prior: $`p(\theta) \propto \exp\left(-\frac{\|\theta\|_2^2}{2\tau^2}\right)`$
2. Log-posterior: $`\log p(\theta|S) = \sum_{i=1}^n \log p(y^{(i)}|x^{(i)}, \theta) - \frac{\|\theta\|_2^2}{2\tau^2} + \text{const}`$
3. MAP objective: $`\arg\max_\theta \sum_{i=1}^n \log p(y^{(i)}|x^{(i)}, \theta) - \lambda \|\theta\|_2^2`$

Where $`\lambda = \frac{1}{2\tau^2}`$.

**Laplace Prior → L1 Regularization:**
If the prior is Laplace, $`p(\theta) \propto \exp(-\lambda \|\theta\|_1)`$, MAP estimation gives L1 regularization (LASSO).

**Practical Note:**  
Regularization helps prevent overfitting by discouraging large parameter values, which often correspond to overly complex models.

---

## Example: Bayesian Logistic Regression

### The Model

Suppose you're doing binary classification with logistic regression. In the Bayesian view, you put a prior on the weights $`\theta`$, and your predictions average over all plausible values of $`\theta`$ given the data.

**Likelihood:**
$`p(y^{(i)}|x^{(i)}, \theta) = h_\theta(x^{(i)})^{y^{(i)}}(1-h_\theta(x^{(i)}))^{(1-y^{(i)})}`$

Where $`h_\theta(x) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-\theta^T x)}`$ is the sigmoid function.

**Prior:**
$`\theta \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \tau^2 I)`$ (Gaussian prior)

**Posterior:**
$`p(\theta|S) \propto \left(\prod_{i=1}^n h_\theta(x^{(i)})^{y^{(i)}}(1-h_\theta(x^{(i)}))^{(1-y^{(i)})}\right) \exp\left(-\frac{\|\theta\|_2^2}{2\tau^2}\right)`$

### MAP Estimation

In practice, you might use the MAP estimate, which is equivalent to regularized logistic regression:

$`\theta_{\text{MAP}} = \arg\max_\theta \sum_{i=1}^n [y^{(i)} \log h_\theta(x^{(i)}) + (1-y^{(i)}) \log(1-h_\theta(x^{(i)}))] - \lambda \|\theta\|_2^2`$

This is exactly the objective function for L2-regularized logistic regression!

## Practical Guidelines

### When to Use Each Approach

**Use MLE when:**
- ✅ You have lots of data
- ✅ You want computational efficiency
- ✅ You don't have strong prior beliefs
- ❌ You have small datasets (risk of overfitting)
- ❌ You need uncertainty quantification

**Use MAP when:**
- ✅ You have some prior knowledge
- ✅ You want regularization
- ✅ You want computational efficiency
- ✅ You have small to medium datasets
- ❌ You need full uncertainty quantification

**Use Full Bayesian when:**
- ✅ You need uncertainty quantification
- ✅ You have strong prior knowledge
- ✅ You want the most principled approach
- ❌ You need computational efficiency
- ❌ You have very large datasets

### Choosing Priors

**Conjugate Priors:**
- **Gaussian prior + Gaussian likelihood → Gaussian posterior**
- **Beta prior + Bernoulli likelihood → Beta posterior**
- **Gamma prior + Poisson likelihood → Gamma posterior**

**Non-informative Priors:**
- **Uniform prior**: $`p(\theta) \propto 1`$
- **Jeffreys prior**: $`p(\theta) \propto \sqrt{I(\theta)}`$ where $`I(\theta)`$ is the Fisher information

**Informative Priors:**
- Based on domain knowledge
- Previous studies or experiments
- Expert opinion

### Computational Considerations

**MLE:**
- Usually fast and straightforward
- Can use standard optimization methods
- No need to specify priors

**MAP:**
- Similar computational cost to MLE
- Need to choose and justify priors
- Can use the same optimization methods

**Full Bayesian:**
- Often computationally expensive
- May require MCMC or variational methods
- Provides uncertainty quantification

## Advanced Topics

### Model Comparison

**Bayesian Model Selection:**
Compare models using the marginal likelihood (evidence):

$`p(S|M) = \int_\theta p(S|\theta, M) p(\theta|M) d\theta`$

**Bayes Factor:**
$`BF = \frac{p(S|M_1)}{p(S|M_2)}`$

- $`BF > 1`$: Model 1 is preferred
- $`BF < 1`$: Model 2 is preferred

### Hierarchical Models

**Multi-level Models:**
- Parameters have their own distributions
- Useful for grouped data
- Example: Students within schools, patients within hospitals

### Approximate Bayesian Methods

**Variational Inference:**
- Approximate the posterior with a simpler distribution
- Faster than MCMC
- Less accurate than exact methods

**MCMC Methods:**
- Metropolis-Hastings
- Hamiltonian Monte Carlo
- No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS)

## From Theoretical Understanding to Practical Implementation

We've now explored **model selection** - the systematic process of choosing among different models, model complexities, and hyperparameters. We've learned how cross-validation provides reliable performance estimates, how Bayesian methods incorporate uncertainty and prior knowledge, and how to avoid common pitfalls in model selection.

However, while understanding the theoretical foundations of regularization and model selection is essential, true mastery comes from **practical implementation**. The concepts we've learned - regularization techniques, cross-validation strategies, and Bayesian approaches - need to be applied to real problems to develop intuition and practical skills.

This motivates our exploration of **hands-on coding** - the practical implementation of all the regularization and model selection concepts we've learned. We'll put our theoretical knowledge into practice by implementing regularization techniques, building cross-validation systems, and developing the practical skills needed to build robust, generalizable models.

The transition from theoretical understanding to practical implementation represents the bridge from knowledge to application - taking our understanding of how regularization and model selection work and turning it into practical tools for building better machine learning models.

In the next section, we'll implement complete systems for regularization and model selection, experiment with different techniques, and develop the practical skills needed for real-world machine learning applications.

## Footnotes

[^5]: Given that we said in the previous set of notes that bias and variance are two very different beasts, some readers may be wondering if we should be calling them "twin" evils here. Perhaps it'd be better to think of them as non-identical twins. The phrase "the fraternal twin evils of bias and variance" doesn't have the same ring to it, though.

[^6]: If we are trying to choose from an infinite set of models, say corresponding to the possible values of the bandwidth $`\tau \in \mathbb{R}^+`$, we may discretize $`\tau`$ and consider only a finite number of possible values for it. More generally, most of the algorithms described here can all be viewed as performing optimization search in the space of models, and we can perform this search over infinite model classes as well.

[^7]: Since we are now viewing $`\theta`$ as a random variable, it is okay to condition on its value, and write $`p(y|x, \theta)`$ instead of $`p(y|x; \theta)`$.

[^8]: The integral below would be replaced by a summation if $`y`$ is discrete-valued.
