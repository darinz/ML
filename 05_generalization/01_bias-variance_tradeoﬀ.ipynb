    "# Neural Networks: From Single Neurons to Deep Architectures\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks represent one of the most powerful and flexible approaches to machine learning, capable of learning complex patterns and relationships from data. At their core, neural networks are computational models inspired by biological neural systems, consisting of interconnected processing units (neurons) organized in layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Are Neural Networks?\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks are mathematical models that can approximate any continuous function given sufficient capacity. They consist of:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input Layer**: Receives the raw data\n",
    "2. **Hidden Layers**: Process and transform the data through non-linear operations\n",
    "3. **Output Layer**: Produces the final prediction or classification\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Non-linear**: Can model complex, non-linear relationships\n",
    "- **Universal**: Can approximate any continuous function (Universal Approximation Theorem)\n",
    "- **Hierarchical**: Learn features at multiple levels of abstraction\n",
    "- **Adaptive**: Parameters are learned from data through optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mathematical Foundation\n",
    "\n",
    "A neural network can be viewed as a composition of functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(x) = f_L \\circ f_{L-1} \\circ \\cdots \\circ f_1(x)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where each $f_i$ represents a layer transformation, and $\\circ$ denotes function composition.\n",
    "\n",
    "## From Mathematical Foundations to Neural Network Architectures\n",
    "\n",
    "We've now established the **mathematical foundations** of deep learning - understanding why non-linear models are necessary, how loss functions capture different types of learning objectives, and how optimization algorithms enable us to find the best parameters for our models. This theoretical framework provides the foundation for understanding how neural networks work.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, while we've discussed non-linear models in abstract terms, we need to move from mathematical concepts to concrete **neural network architectures**. The transition from understanding why non-linear models are powerful to actually building them requires us to explore how simple computational units (neurons) can be combined to create complex learning systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "This motivates our exploration of **neural networks** - the specific architectural framework that implements non-linear models through interconnected layers of neurons. We'll see how the mathematical principles we've established (non-linear transformations, function composition, optimization) translate into concrete neural network designs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The transition from non-linear models to neural networks represents the bridge from mathematical theory to practical architecture - taking our understanding of why non-linear models work and turning it into a systematic approach for building them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we'll explore how individual neurons work, how they can be combined into layers, and how these layers can be stacked to create deep architectures that can learn increasingly complex patterns.\n",

    "## 7.2 From Linear to Non-Linear: The Single Neuron\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Building Block: The Artificial Neuron\n",
    "\n",
    "The artificial neuron is the fundamental computational unit of neural networks. It performs three basic operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Linear Combination**: $z = w^T x + b$\n",
    "2. **Non-linear Activation**: $a = \\sigma(z)$\n",
    "3. **Output**: The activated value becomes the neuron's output\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mathematical Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "For a single neuron with input $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "z = w^T x + b\n",
    "a = \\sigma(z)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $w \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ is the weight vector\n",
    "- $b \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is the bias term\n",
    "- $\\sigma: \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is the activation function\n",
    "- $z$ is the pre-activation (or logit)\n",
    "- $a$ is the activation (or output)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Non-Linear Activation Functions?\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Problem with Linear Activations**: If we used $\\sigma(z) = z$ (linear activation), then:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(x) = w_2^T (W_1 x + b_1) + b_2 = (w_2^T W_1) x + (w_2^T b_1 + b_2) = W' x + b'\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This reduces to a linear function, losing the power of non-linearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Solution**: Non-linear activation functions introduce the ability to model complex, non-linear relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Activation Functions\n",

    "#### 1. Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)\n",

    "- **Advantages**: Simple, computationally efficient, helps with vanishing gradient problem\n",
    "- **Disadvantages**: Can cause \"dying ReLU\" problem (neurons stuck at zero)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Sigmoid Function\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sigma(z) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Properties**:\n",
    "- **Range**: $(0, 1)$\n",
    "- **Derivative**: $\\sigma'(z) = \\sigma(z)(1 - \\sigma(z))$\n",
    "- **Advantages**: Smooth, bounded output, interpretable as probability\n",
    "- **Disadvantages**: Suffers from vanishing gradient problem\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Hyperbolic Tangent (tanh)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sigma(z) = \\frac{e^z - e^{-z}}{e^z + e^{-z}}\n",

    "### Single Neuron Example: Housing Price Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider predicting house prices based on house size. A single neuron with ReLU activation can model the relationship:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{h}_\\theta(x) = \\max(w \\cdot x + b, 0)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",

    "- $x$ is the house size (square feet)\n",
    "- $w$ is the price per square foot\n",
    "- $b$ is the base price\n",
    "- The ReLU ensures non-negative predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intuition**: The neuron learns to predict a price that increases linearly with size, but never goes below zero (which makes sense for house prices).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mathematical Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why ReLU Works Well**:\n",
    "1. **Non-linearity**: Introduces a \"kink\" at $x = -b/w$\n",
    "2. **Sparsity**: Can produce exact zeros, leading to sparse representations\n",

    "\n",
    "### Mathematical Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Universal Approximation Theorem**: A neural network with a single hidden layer containing a sufficient number of neurons can approximate any continuous function on a compact domain to arbitrary precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intuition**: Just as any function can be approximated by a sum of basis functions, any function can be approximated by a combination of non-linear transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Two-Layer Network Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "A two-layer network consists of:\n",

    "\n",
    "Each hidden neuron learns to detect a specific feature or pattern in the input:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Feature Detectors**: Each neuron becomes specialized in recognizing certain input patterns\n",
    "2. **Feature Combination**: The output layer learns to combine these features for the final prediction\n",
    "3. **Hierarchical Learning**: Complex features are built from simpler ones\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Housing Price Prediction with Multiple Features\n",

    "## From Neural Network Fundamentals to Modular Design\n",
    "\n",
    "We've now explored the fundamental building blocks of neural networks - from individual neurons with their activation functions to multi-layer architectures that can learn complex patterns. We've seen how the mathematical principles of non-linear transformations and function composition translate into concrete neural network designs.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, as neural networks become more complex and are applied to increasingly sophisticated problems, we need to move beyond basic architectures to **modular design principles**. Modern deep learning systems are built using reusable components that can be composed to create complex architectures efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "This motivates our exploration of **neural network modules** - the building blocks that enable us to construct sophisticated architectures systematically. We'll see how common patterns (like fully connected layers, convolutional layers, and attention mechanisms) can be implemented as reusable modules that can be combined in various ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "The transition from neural network fundamentals to modular design represents the bridge from understanding basic architectures to building practical, scalable systems - taking our knowledge of how neural networks work and turning it into a systematic approach for constructing complex models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next section, we'll explore how to design and implement neural network modules, how to compose them into larger architectures, and how this modular approach enables both flexibility and efficiency in deep learning systems.\n",
