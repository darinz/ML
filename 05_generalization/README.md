# Generalization in Machine Learning

This folder contains comprehensive notes, detailed explanations, and enhanced code examples related to the theory and practice of generalization in machine learning. The materials are designed to provide deep understanding of how and why machine learning models generalize to new data, and what factors influence their performance on unseen examples.

**Key Concepts:**
- Interpolation threshold: n ≈ d (samples ≈ parameters)
- Overparameterized regime: d > n
- Implicit regularization in modern optimizers

### 3. **Sample Complexity Bounds** (`03_complexity_bounds.md`)
