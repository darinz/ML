# Generalization in Machine Learning

This folder contains notes, explanations, and code examples related to the theory and practice of generalization in machine learning. The materials are designed to help you understand how and why machine learning models generalize to new data, and what factors influence their performance on unseen examples.

## Topics Covered

- **Bias-Variance Tradeoff** (`01_bias-variance_tradeoï¬€.md`)
  - Explains the fundamental tradeoff between underfitting and overfitting.
  - Includes mathematical derivations, intuitive explanations, and Python code to visualize bias, variance, and error.

- **Double Descent Phenomenon** (`02_double_descent.md`)
  - Describes the modern observation that test error can decrease, then increase, then decrease again as model complexity grows.
  - Covers both model-wise and sample-wise double descent, with code to simulate and visualize these effects.

- **Sample Complexity Bounds** (`03_complexity_bounds.md`)
  - Introduces learning theory concepts such as the union bound, Hoeffding/Chernoff bounds, empirical risk minimization, VC dimension, and sample complexity.
  - Provides step-by-step derivations, intuitive explanations, and code to demonstrate key results.

## Code Examples

- **bias_variance_decomposition_examples.py**
  - Simulates and visualizes bias, variance, and error for different model complexities.
  - Shows the bias-variance tradeoff in action.

- **double_descent_examples.py**
  - Demonstrates model-wise and sample-wise double descent using polynomial and linear regression.
  - Shows the effect of regularization on double descent.

- **complexity_bounds_examples.py**
  - Simulates the union bound, Hoeffding/Chernoff bounds, empirical risk, generalization error, and VC dimension.
  - Visualizes sample complexity bounds and shattering in 2D.

## How to Run the Code

All code files are written in Python and require `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `scipy` (for some examples). To run a code file, use:

```bash
python filename.py
```

For example:
```bash
python bias_variance_decomposition_examples.py
```

Each script is self-contained and prints or plots results to help you build intuition about generalization.

## Educational Focus

These materials are intended for students and practitioners who want to deepen their understanding of generalization in machine learning. The notes combine mathematical rigor with intuitive explanations and practical code, making them suitable for self-study or as a supplement to a machine learning course.
