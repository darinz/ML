python bias_variance_tradeoff_demo.py

# Run double descent examples
python double_descent_examples.py

# Run complexity bounds examples
python complexity_bounds_examples.py
```

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

### Bias-Variance Tradeoff

2. **Error Decomposition**: Breaking down total error into bias², variance, and irreducible error
3. **Overfitting vs Underfitting**: Visual and quantitative analysis of model behavior
4. **Optimal Complexity**: Finding the sweet spot between bias and variance

### Double Descent

1. **Model-Wise Double Descent**: Three-regime phenomenon (underparameterized, interpolation threshold, overparameterized)
2. **Sample-Wise Double Descent**: How varying training sample size affects generalization
3. **Minimum Norm Solution**: Why gradient descent finds solutions that generalize well
4. **Complexity Measures**: Parameter count vs model norm as complexity measures
5. **Regularization Effects**: How regularization mitigates peaks at interpolation threshold

### Complexity Bounds

1. **Theoretical Foundations**: Mathematical bounds on generalization error
2. **VC Dimension**: Measuring model complexity
3. **Rademacher Complexity**: Alternative complexity measures
4. **Practical Implications**: How theory guides practice
