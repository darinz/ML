```

## Usage

Each Python file can be run independently to demonstrate specific concepts:

```bash
# Run bias-variance tradeoff demonstration
python bias_variance_tradeoff_demo.py

# Run double descent examples
python double_descent_examples.py

# Run complexity bounds examples
python complexity_bounds_examples.py
```

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

### Bias-Variance Tradeoff

1. **U-Shaped Curve**: How model complexity affects training and test error
2. **Error Decomposition**: Breaking down total error into biasÂ², variance, and irreducible error
3. **Overfitting vs Underfitting**: Visual and quantitative analysis of model behavior
4. **Optimal Complexity**: Finding the sweet spot between bias and variance

### Double Descent

1. **Classical U-Shape**: The traditional bias-variance tradeoff
2. **Interpolation Threshold**: When models can fit training data perfectly
3. **Second Descent**: How very complex models can generalize well
4. **Modern Understanding**: Why deep learning models work despite being overparameterized

### Complexity Bounds

1. **Theoretical Foundations**: Mathematical bounds on generalization error
2. **VC Dimension**: Measuring model complexity
3. **Rademacher Complexity**: Alternative complexity measures
4. **Practical Implications**: How theory guides practice

## Expected Outcomes

After working through these examples, you should be able to:

- **Diagnose Model Problems**: Identify whether a model is overfitting or underfitting
- **Select Model Complexity**: Choose appropriate model complexity for given data
