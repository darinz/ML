**Question:** Which of the following is the cause/reason for irreducible error?

**Options:**
- a) Stochastic label noise
- b) Very few data points
- c) Nonlinear relationships in the data
- d) Insufficient model complexity

## Problem 2: Bias-Variance Analysis

**1 points One Answer**

**Scenario:** Saket unfortunately did not learn from the midterm and still has not attended lecture. He is now given the task of training 3 neural networks with increasing complexity on a regression task:

* Model A: 1 hidden layer with 10 neurons.
* Model B: 2 hidden layers with 50 neurons each.
* Model C: 10 hidden layers with 100 neurons each.

After training and evaluating these models on an appropriately split dataset with train and test splits, you find the following MSEs:

* Model A: train MSE = 2.5, test MSE = 2.6
* Model B: train MSE = 0.1, test MSE = 0.2
* Model C: train MSE = 0.01, test MSE = 1.3

Saket only knows about bias and variance, So based on the model architectures and train/test MSE losses, chose the best relative bias/variance estimates for each of the models.

**Problem Description:** Imagine you are trying to find an optimal weight $w$ for a simple model. You have a small dataset consisting of two data points, each influencing the overall loss:
* Data point 1: $(x_1, y_1) = (5,4)$
* Data point 2: $(x_2, y_2) = (1,3)$

$$L_i(w) = (y_i - w \cdot x_i)^2$$

Your current weight parameter is $w_0 = 1$. You will perform one iteration of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) using a learning rate $\alpha = 0.1$.
