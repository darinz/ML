    "# Practice Problem Set 2 Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem 1\n",
    "\n",
    "A fair six-sided die is rolled twice. What is the conditional probability that the first roll showed a 2, given that the sum of the two rolls is 6?\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) $\\frac{1}{6}$\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) $\\frac{1}{5}$\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) $\\frac{3}{11}$\n",
    "\n",
    "(d) $\\frac{2}{5}$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct answers:** (b)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a **conditional probability** problem. We need to find $P(\\text{First roll} = 2 \\mid \\text{Sum} = 6)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define the Events:**\n",
    "   - Event $A$: First roll shows a 2\n",
    "   - Event $B$: Sum of two rolls equals 6\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Find $P(B)$ - Total ways to get sum of 6:**\n",
    "   The possible combinations that sum to 6 are:\n",
    "   - $(1,5)$ - First roll: 1, Second roll: 5\n",
    "   - $(2,4)$ - First roll: 2, Second roll: 4  \n",
    "   - $(3,3)$ - First roll: 3, Second roll: 3\n",
    "   - $(4,2)$ - First roll: 4, Second roll: 2\n",
    "   - $(5,1)$ - First roll: 5, Second roll: 1\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Total: 5 equally likely outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Find $P(A \\cap B)$ - Ways to get sum of 6 AND first roll is 2:**\n",
    "   Only one combination satisfies both conditions: $(2,4)$\n",
    "   \n",
    "   So $P(A \\cap B) = \\frac{1}{36}$ (since there are 36 total possible outcomes for two dice)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Apply Conditional Probability Formula:**\n",
    "   $$P(A \\mid B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{36}}{\\frac{5}{36}} = \\frac{1}{5}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alternative Intuitive Approach:**\n",
    "Since we know the sum is 6, we're only considering the 5 possible combinations above. Among these 5 equally likely outcomes, only one has the first roll as 2. Therefore, the probability is $\\frac{1}{5}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Verification:**\n",
    "- Total outcomes for two dice: $6 \\times 6 = 36$\n",
    "- Outcomes with sum 6: 5\n",
    "- Outcomes with sum 6 AND first roll 2: 1\n",
    "- Conditional probability: $\\frac{1}{5}$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem 2\n",
    "\n",
    "If matrix A has distinct eigenvalues, what can be said about its eigenvectors?\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) The eigenvectors form a linearly independent set\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) The eigenvalues are orthogonal to each other\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) A must be positive semi-definite\n",
    "\n",
    "(d) None of the above\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct answers:** (a)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The correct answer is **(a)** - the eigenvectors form a linearly independent set. Here's the detailed explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Theorem:**\n",
    "If a matrix $A$ has **distinct eigenvalues**, then the corresponding eigenvectors are **linearly independent**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Proof:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Eigenvalue-Eigenvector Relationship:**\n",
    "   For distinct eigenvalues $\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\ldots, \\lambda_n$ and corresponding eigenvectors $v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_n$:\n",
    "   $$Av_i = \\lambda_i v_i \\quad \\text{for } i = 1, 2, \\ldots, n$$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Linear Independence Proof by Contradiction:**\n",
    "   Assume the eigenvectors are linearly dependent. Then there exist scalars $c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_n$ (not all zero) such that:\n",
    "   $$c_1 v_1 + c_2 v_2 + \\cdots + c_n v_n = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Applying Matrix A:**\n",
    "   $$A(c_1 v_1 + c_2 v_2 + \\cdots + c_n v_n) = A \\cdot 0 = 0$$\n",
    "   $$c_1 Av_1 + c_2 Av_2 + \\cdots + c_n Av_n = 0$$\n",
    "   $$c_1 \\lambda_1 v_1 + c_2 \\lambda_2 v_2 + \\cdots + c_n \\lambda_n v_n = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Subtracting Scaled Original Equation:**\n",
    "   Multiply the original equation by $\\lambda_1$:\n",
    "   $$c_1 \\lambda_1 v_1 + c_2 \\lambda_1 v_2 + \\cdots + c_n \\lambda_1 v_n = 0$$\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Subtract from the previous equation:\n",
    "   $$c_2(\\lambda_2 - \\lambda_1)v_2 + c_3(\\lambda_3 - \\lambda_1)v_3 + \\cdots + c_n(\\lambda_n - \\lambda_1)v_n = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Contradiction:**\n",
    "   Since $\\lambda_i \\neq \\lambda_1$ for $i > 1$, and $v_2, v_3, \\ldots, v_n$ are linearly independent (by induction), we must have $c_2 = c_3 = \\cdots = c_n = 0$. This contradicts our assumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Other Options Are Incorrect:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **(b) Eigenvalues are orthogonal**: Eigenvalues are scalars, not vectors, so they can't be orthogonal\n",
    "- **(c) A must be positive semi-definite**: Not true - matrices with distinct eigenvalues can be indefinite\n",
    "- **(d) None of the above**: Incorrect since (a) is true\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Note:**\n",
    "The question could have been more precise by specifying \"eigenvectors corresponding to distinct eigenvalues form a linearly independent set,\" but the intent is clear from the context.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem 3\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of multi-class logistic regression, which statement most accurately describes the decision boundaries?\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) They are linear and distinctly separate distinct classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) They are non-linear and may overlap.\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) They remain unchanged, regardless of any transformations of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "(d) They may be linear or non-linear, depending on the distribution of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct answers:** (a)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The correct answer is **(a)** - the decision boundaries are linear and distinctly separate distinct classes. Here's the detailed explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multi-Class Logistic Regression Model:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Model Formulation:**\n",
    "   For $k$ classes, the model outputs probabilities:\n",
    "   $$P(y = i \\mid x) = \\frac{e^{w_i^T x + b_i}}{\\sum_{j=1}^k e^{w_j^T x + b_j}}$$\n",
    "   \n",
    "   where $w_i$ and $b_i$ are the weights and bias for class $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Decision Rule:**\n",
    "   The predicted class is:\n",
    "   $$\\hat{y} = \\arg\\max_{i} P(y = i \\mid x) = \\arg\\max_{i} (w_i^T x + b_i)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Decision Boundaries Are Linear:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Linear Decision Functions:**\n",
    "   The decision function for class $i$ vs class $j$ is:\n",
    "   $$f_{ij}(x) = (w_i^T x + b_i) - (w_j^T x + b_j) = (w_i - w_j)^T x + (b_i - b_j)$$\n",
    "   \n",
    "   This is a **linear function** of $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Decision Boundary:**\n",
    "   The decision boundary between classes $i$ and $j$ occurs when:\n",
    "   $$f_{ij}(x) = 0$$\n",
    "   $$(w_i - w_j)^T x + (b_i - b_j) = 0$$\n",
    "   \n",
    "   This is a **linear equation** in $x$, representing a **hyperplane**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Visual Example in 2D:**\n",
    "For 3 classes, the decision boundaries are three lines that divide the plane into three regions:\n",
    "- Class 1: $w_1^T x + b_1 > w_2^T x + b_2$ AND $w_1^T x + b_1 > w_3^T x + b_3$\n",
    "- Class 2: $w_2^T x + b_2 > w_1^T x + b_1$ AND $w_2^T x + b_2 > w_3^T x + b_3$\n",
    "- Class 3: $w_3^T x + b_3 > w_1^T x + b_1$ AND $w_3^T x + b_3 > w_2^T x + b_2$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Boundaries Don't Overlap:**\n",
    "- Each point belongs to exactly one class (mutually exclusive)\n",
    "- The decision boundaries are the boundaries between these regions\n",
    "- At any point on a decision boundary, the probabilities for the two adjacent classes are equal\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Verification:**\n",
    "The decision boundary between classes $i$ and $j$ is:\n",
    "$$(w_i - w_j)^T x + (b_i - b_j) = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a linear hyperplane in the feature space, confirming that multi-class logistic regression produces linear decision boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Contrast with Non-Linear Methods:**\n",
    "- **Kernel SVM**: Can produce non-linear decision boundaries\n",
    "- **Neural Networks**: Can learn complex, non-linear decision boundaries\n",
    "- **Decision Trees**: Produce piecewise linear boundaries\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Which of the following is true about linear and logistic regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Both models output a probability distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Both models are good choices for regression classes of problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) Both models are good choices for classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct answers:** (c)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The correct answer is **(c)** - both models are good choices for classification. Here's the detailed explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Linear Regression for Classification:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mathematical Foundation:**\n",
    "   Linear regression can be used for binary classification by:\n",
    "   - Training: $\\min_w \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - w^T x_i)^2$\n",
    "   - Prediction: $\\hat{y} = \\text{sign}(w^T x)$\n",
    "   \n",
    "   where $y_i \\in \\{-1, +1\\}$ for binary classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Why It Works:**\n",
    "   - The squared error loss encourages $w^T x_i$ to be close to $y_i$\n",
    "   - For $y_i = +1$, we want $w^T x_i > 0$\n",
    "   - For $y_i = -1$, we want $w^T x_i < 0$\n",
    "   - This naturally creates a linear decision boundary\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Advantages:**\n",
    "   - **Simple and fast**: Closed-form solution available\n",
    "   - **Interpretable**: Weights have clear meaning\n",
    "   - **Stable**: Unique solution when $X^T X$ is invertible\n",
    "   - **Good baseline**: Often performs surprisingly well\n",
    "\n",
    "**Logistic Regression for Classification:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mathematical Foundation:**\n",
    "   $$P(y = 1 \\mid x) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-w^T x}}$$\n",
    "   \n",
    "   The model maximizes the likelihood of the observed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Advantages:**\n",
    "   - **Probabilistic output**: Direct probability estimates\n",
    "   - **Well-calibrated**: Probabilities are meaningful\n",
    "   - **Convex optimization**: Guaranteed global optimum\n",
    "   - **Regularization friendly**: Easy to add L1/L2 penalties\n",

    "- When you need to handle class imbalance\n",
    "\n",
    "**Historical Context:**\n",
    "Linear regression was actually used for classification before logistic regression became popular. The famous Fisher's Iris dataset was originally classified using linear discriminant analysis, which is closely related to linear regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The question was revised because option (b) was ambiguous about what \"regression classes of problems\" means.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you train a binary classifier in which the final two layers of your model are a ReLU activation followed by a sigmoid activation. How will this affect the domain of your final predictions?\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) This will cause all predictions to be positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) This will have no effect on the distribution of predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) This will cause cause all predictions to be negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "(d) None of the above.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct answers:** (a)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The correct answer is **(a)** - this will cause all predictions to be positive. Here's the detailed explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Understanding the Architecture:**\n",
    "The model has two final layers:\n",
    "1. **ReLU activation**: $f(x) = \\max(0, x)$\n",
    "2. **Sigmoid activation**: $g(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Analysis:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **ReLU Function Properties:**\n",
    "   - $f(x) = \\max(0, x)$\n",
    "   - Output range: $[0, \\infty)$\n",
    "   - All outputs are **non-negative**\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sigmoid Function Properties:**\n",
    "   - $g(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}$\n",
    "   - Output range: $(0, 1)$\n",
    "   - Monotonic increasing function\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Composition Effect:**\n",
    "   Let $z$ be the input to the ReLU layer, then:\n",
    "   - ReLU output: $a = \\max(0, z) \\geq 0$\n",
    "   - Sigmoid input: $a \\geq 0$\n",
    "   - Final output: $g(a) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-a}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Key Insight:**\n",
    "   Since $a \\geq 0$ (due to ReLU), we have:\n",
    "   - When $a = 0$: $g(0) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^0} = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5$\n",
    "   - When $a > 0$: $g(a) > 0.5$ (because sigmoid is increasing)\n",
    "   - When $a \\to \\infty$: $g(a) \\to 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why All Predictions Are Positive:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **ReLU Constraint**: The ReLU layer ensures all inputs to the sigmoid are non-negative\n",
    "2. **Sigmoid Behavior**: For non-negative inputs, sigmoid outputs values in $(0.5, 1]$\n",
    "3. **No Negative Predictions**: The model can never output values below 0.5\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Verification:**\n",
    "For any input $z$ to the ReLU layer:\n",
    "$$\\text{Output} = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-\\max(0, z)}} \\geq \\frac{1}{1 + e^0} = 0.5$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practical Implications:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Binary Classification**: If using 0.5 as threshold, all predictions would be class 1\n",
    "2. **Probability Interpretation**: All probabilities would be $\\geq 0.5$\n",
    "3. **Model Limitation**: The model cannot represent the full range of probabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "**Better Alternatives:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Remove ReLU**: Use only sigmoid for probability output\n",
    "2. **Use Different Activation**: Replace ReLU with tanh or linear activation\n",
    "3. **Adjust Architecture**: Use softmax for multi-class or different activation pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- Input to ReLU: $z = -2$\n",
    "- ReLU output: $a = \\max(0, -2) = 0$\n",
    "- Sigmoid output: $g(0) = 0.5$\n",
    "- Even negative inputs result in 0.5 probability!\n",

    "## Problem 6\n",
    "\n",
    "You are tasked with building a regression model to predict whether an email is spam [label=1] or not spam [label=0] based on various features. You are debating using linear or logistic regression. What type of regression is most suitable and why?\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Linear regression, because it is optimized for learning the influence of multiple features.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Linear regression, because logistic regression cannot predict the comparative magnitude of the likelihood that an email is spam.\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) Logistic regression, because it models the probability of an instance belonging to a particular class.\n",
    "\n",
    "(d) Logistic regression, because it allows for complex non-linear interactions between features and thus will be more accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct answers:** (c)\n",

    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The correct answer is **(c)** - logistic regression is most suitable because it models the probability of an instance belonging to a particular class. Here's the detailed explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Logistic Regression is Ideal for Binary Classification:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Probabilistic Output:**\n",
    "   Logistic regression outputs a probability between 0 and 1:\n",
    "   $$P(\\text{spam} \\mid x) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-(w^T x + b)}}$$\n",
    "   \n",
    "   This directly represents the probability that an email is spam.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Mathematical Properties:**\n",
    "   - **Range**: Output is always in $[0, 1]$, perfect for probabilities\n",
    "   - **Monotonic**: As $w^T x + b$ increases, probability increases\n",
    "   - **Interpretable**: Log-odds are linear in the features\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Decision Rule:**\n",
    "   - If $P(\\text{spam} \\mid x) > 0.5$, classify as spam\n",
    "   - If $P(\\text{spam} \\mid x) \\leq 0.5$, classify as not spam\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Linear Regression is Inappropriate:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Unbounded Output:**\n",
    "   Linear regression can output any real number: $\\hat{y} = w^T x + b \\in (-\\infty, \\infty)$\n",
    "   \n",
    "   This doesn't make sense for probabilities, which must be in $[0, 1]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **No Probability Interpretation:**\n",
    "   - Output of 2.5 doesn't mean 250% probability\n",
    "   - Output of -1 doesn't mean -100% probability\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Poor Calibration:**\n",
    "   Linear regression doesn't produce well-calibrated probability estimates\n",

    "- **(b) Linear regression for comparative magnitude**: This is incorrect - logistic regression can provide probability estimates\n",
    "- **(d) Logistic regression for non-linear interactions**: While logistic regression can be extended with kernels, this isn't the primary reason for choosing it\n",

    "**(a) The optimal $\\hat{w}$ is always a linear combination of $x_i$'s for $i = 1, 2, ..., n$.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**FALSE** ❌\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- The optimal $\\hat{w}$ is a linear combination of **$\\phi(x_i)$'s**, not $x_i$'s\n",
    "- This is the **Representer Theorem**: $\\hat{w} = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\alpha_i \\phi(x_i)$\n",
    "- The feature mapping $\\phi$ transforms $x_i$ to a higher-dimensional space\n",
    "- Since $d \\neq q$, the original $x_i$'s and $\\phi(x_i)$'s are in different spaces\n",

    "\n",
    "**FALSE** ❌\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- The correct formula is: $\\hat{\\alpha} = (K + \\lambda I)^{-1}Y$\n",
    "- The kernel matrix $K$ is already $n \\times n$, so we don't need $KK^T$\n",
    "- $KK^T$ would be $n \\times n \\times n \\times n$, which doesn't make sense dimensionally\n",
    "\n",
    "**Derivation of Correct Formula:**\n",
    "1. Using the Representer Theorem: $\\hat{w} = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\alpha_i \\phi(x_i)$\n",
    "2. The objective becomes: $\\min_{\\alpha} \\frac{1}{n} ||Y - K\\alpha||^2 + \\lambda \\alpha^T K \\alpha$\n",
    "3. Setting derivative to zero: $-2K^T(Y - K\\alpha) + 2\\lambda K\\alpha = 0$\n",
    "4. Since $K$ is symmetric: $K(Y - K\\alpha) = \\lambda K\\alpha$\n",

    "\n",
    "**TRUE** ✅\n",

    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- Kernel methods only require the kernel function $K(x_i, x_j) = \\langle \\phi(x_i), \\phi(x_j) \\rangle$\n",
    "- The feature mapping $\\phi$ doesn't need to be injective (one-to-one)\n",
    "- Multiple different inputs could map to the same feature representation\n",
    "- The kernel trick allows us to work with $K$ directly without computing $\\phi$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- Consider $\\phi(x) = [x, x^2]$ for $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$\n",
    "- This is not one-to-one (e.g., $\\phi(2) = \\phi(-2) = [2, 4]$)\n",
    "- But the kernel $K(x_i, x_j) = x_i x_j + x_i^2 x_j^2$ is still valid\n",

    "\n",
    "**TRUE** ✅\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- When $\\lambda = 0$, the problem becomes: $\\min_w \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - w^T \\phi(x_i))^2$\n",
    "- This is equivalent to: $\\min_w ||Y - X_{\\phi} w||^2$ where $X_{\\phi} = [\\phi(x_1), \\ldots, \\phi(x_n)]^T$\n",
    "- The solution is: $\\hat{w} = (X_{\\phi}^T X_{\\phi})^+ X_{\\phi}^T Y$ where $^+$ denotes the pseudo-inverse\n",
    "- Since $K = X_{\\phi} X_{\\phi}^T$ is PSD, the pseudo-inverse exists\n",
