    "\n",
    "Consider the following matrix $X$ with four data points in\n",
    "$\\mathbb{R}^2$. We would like to use PCA to find a rank-1 linear\n",
    "representation of these data.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$X = \n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix} \n",
    "4 & 1 \\\\ \n",
    "5 & 4 \\\\ \n",
    "1 & 2 \\\\ \n",
    "1 & 0 \n",

    "\n",
    "**Figure 2:** These plots depict data points from the four-sample\n",
    "dataset $X$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Which line in Figure 2 represents the direction of the first principal\n",
    "component of $X - \\mu$, where $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$ the vector\n",
    "$\\mu \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ is the featurewise mean of $X$?\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Plot 1  \n",
    "2.  Plot 2  \n",
    "3.  Plot 3  \n",
    "4.  Plot 4\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** The answer is (A).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** The first principal component is the direction of\n",
    "maximum variance in the data. After centering the data by subtracting\n",
    "the mean $\\mu$, PCA finds the eigenvector corresponding to the largest\n",
    "eigenvalue of the covariance matrix. This direction represents the line\n",
    "along which the data has the highest variance. In the figure, Plot 1\n",
    "shows the line that best captures the spread of the centered data\n",
    "points, indicating it’s the direction of the first principal component.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Which of the following statements about kernels is false?\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Kernel feature vectors $\\phi(x_i)$ can be infinite-dimensional  \n",
    "2.  Kernels methods scale well to large datasets because the size of the\n",
    "    kernel matrix does not depend on the size of the dataset  \n",
    "3.  Kernel matrices store the results of inner products of the data’s\n",
    "    features computed in a higher-dimensional space  \n",
    "4.  Kernels allow otherwise linear models to find non-linear decision\n",
    "    boundaries\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** The answer is (B).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** Statement (B) is false because the kernel matrix $K$\n",
    "has size $n \\times n$ where $n$ is the number of data points. As the\n",
    "dataset size increases, the kernel matrix grows quadratically, making\n",
    "kernel methods computationally expensive for large datasets. The other\n",
    "statements are true: (A) kernel feature vectors can indeed be\n",
    "infinite-dimensional (e.g., RBF kernel), (C) kernel matrices store inner\n",
    "products $\\langle \\phi(x_i), \\phi(x_j) \\rangle$, and (D) the kernel\n",
    "trick allows linear models to operate in high-dimensional feature\n",
    "spaces, effectively creating non-linear decision boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have a logistic regression model for spam detection, using a\n",
    "dataset with a binary outcome that indicates whether an email is spam\n",
    "(1) or not spam (0). The predictor variables $x_1$, $x_2$, and $x_3$ are\n",
    "boolean values (0 or 1) that indicate whether the email contains the\n",
    "words “free”, “order”, and “homework”, respectively. The model has four\n",
    "parameters: weights $w_1$, $w_2$, $w_3$, and offset $b$. You find that\n",
    "emails containing the words “free” and “order” have a higher probability\n",
    "of being spam, while emails containing the word “homework” have a lower\n",
    "probability of being spam. Given this information, which of the\n",
    "following signs is most likely for the weights $w_1$, $w_2$, and $w_3$?\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  All positive  \n",
    "2.  All negative  \n",
    "3.  $w_1$ and $w_2$ are positive, $w_3$ is negative  \n",
    "4.  $w_1$ and $w_2$ are negative, $w_3$ is positive\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** The answer is (C).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** In logistic regression, the probability of being spam\n",
    "is given by\n",
    "$P(\\text{spam}) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-(w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + w_3 x_3 + b)}}$.\n",
    "If words “free” and “order” increase the probability of being spam, then\n",
    "$w_1$ and $w_2$ must be positive (since $x_1 = 1$ and $x_2 = 1$ for\n",
    "these words). If the word “homework” decreases the probability of being\n",
    "spam, then $w_3$ must be negative (since $x_3 = 1$ for this word).\n",
    "Therefore, $w_1 > 0$, $w_2 > 0$, and $w_3 < 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "**True/False:** Solving the k-means objective is an unsupervised\n",
    "learning problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  True  \n",
    "2.  False\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** The answer is (A).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** K-means is indeed an unsupervised learning problem\n",
    "because it does not use any labeled training data. The algorithm groups\n",
    "data points into clusters based on their similarity (distance) without\n",
    "any prior knowledge of the correct cluster assignments. The objective is\n",
    "to minimize the within-cluster sum of squares:\n",
    "$\\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\sum_{x \\in C_i} ||x - \\mu_i||^2$, where $\\mu_i$ is the\n",
    "centroid of cluster $C_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Which of the following is typical for decision trees trained to have 0\n",
    "training error?\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  High bias, low variance  \n",
    "2.  High bias, high variance  \n",
    "3.  Low bias, high variance  \n",
    "4.  Low bias, low variance\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** The answer is (C).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** Decision trees trained to have 0 training error\n",
    "(perfect fit to training data) typically have low bias but high\n",
    "variance. This is because they can perfectly memorize the training data\n",
    "by growing deep enough to classify each training point correctly.\n",
    "However, this leads to overfitting, where the model captures noise in\n",
    "the training data and fails to generalize well to unseen data, resulting\n",
    "in high variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 6\n",
    "\n",
    "When is PCA ineffective?\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  When data has an orthogonal underlying structure.  \n",
    "2.  When the data’s underlying low-dimensional structure is\n",
    "    non-linear.  \n",
    "3.  When the data is standardized.  \n",
    "4.  When data visualisation is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** The answer is (B).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** PCA is a linear dimensionality reduction technique that\n",
    "finds linear projections of the data. When the data’s underlying\n",
    "structure is non-linear (e.g., data lying on a curved manifold), PCA\n",
    "cannot effectively capture this structure because it only considers\n",
    "linear relationships. In such cases, non-linear dimensionality reduction\n",
    "techniques like t-SNE, UMAP, or kernel PCA would be more appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 7\n",
    "\n",
    "The kernel matrix $K$ is not\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Symmetric  \n",
    "2.  Square  \n",
    "3.  Positive semi-definite (defined as $x^T Kx > 0$ for every nonzero\n",
    "    column vector $x$; a necessary condition for this is that $K$ has\n",
    "    nonnegative eigenvalues).  \n",
    "4.  Elementwise positive\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** The answer is (D).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** The kernel matrix $K$ is defined as\n",
    "$K_{ij} = \\langle \\phi(x_i), \\phi(x_j) \\rangle$. It is always symmetric\n",
    "because $K_{ij} = K_{ji}$, square because it has dimensions $n \\times n$\n",
    "for $n$ data points, and positive semi-definite because it represents\n",
    "inner products in a feature space. However, it is not necessarily\n",
    "elementwise positive - some kernel values can be negative (e.g., in\n",
    "polynomial kernels with negative coefficients).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 8\n",
    "\n",
    "**True/False:** Ridge regression’s optimal parameters\n",
    "$\\hat{w} = (X^T X + \\lambda I)^{-1} X^T y$ are a linear combination of\n",
    "the data points $x_i$ in $X$.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  True  \n",
    "2.  False\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** The answer is (A).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** This is true because ridge regression can be rewritten\n",
    "in dual form. The solution $\\hat{w} = (X^T X + \\lambda I)^{-1} X^T y$\n",
    "can be expressed as $\\hat{w} = X^T \\alpha$ where\n",
    "$\\alpha = (XX^T + \\lambda I)^{-1} y$. This shows that the optimal\n",
    "weights are indeed a linear combination of the data points, with\n",
    "coefficients given by the dual variables $\\alpha$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 9\n",
    "\n",
    "**True/False:** Solving the k-means objective with Lloyd’s algorithm\n",
    "(shown in lecture) will always converge to the global optimum of the\n",
    "k-means objective.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  True  \n",
    "2.  False\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** The answer is (B).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** Lloyd’s algorithm for k-means is a local optimization\n",
    "method that can get stuck in local minima. The algorithm alternates\n",
    "between assigning points to nearest centroids and updating centroids,\n",
    "but this process doesn’t guarantee finding the global minimum of the\n",
    "k-means objective. Different initializations can lead to different local\n",
    "optima, which is why k-means is often run multiple times with different\n",
    "random initializations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 10\n",
    "\n",
    "When might it be appropriate to use ridge regression instead of\n",
    "(unregularized) least square regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  When the data is linearly separable.  \n",
    "2.  When the number of predictor variables is very large relative to the\n",
    "    number of observations ($d > n$).  \n",
    "3.  When there are categorical or one-hot features in the input\n",
    "    dataset.  \n",
    "4.  When the data is not standardized.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** The answer is (B).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** Ridge regression is particularly useful when $d > n$\n",
    "(more features than samples) because in this case, the unregularized\n",
    "least squares problem is underdetermined and has infinitely many\n",
    "solutions. Ridge regression adds an $L_2$ penalty term\n",
    "$\\lambda ||w||_2^2$ to the objective function, which helps stabilize the\n",
    "solution and prevent overfitting by shrinking the coefficients toward\n",
    "zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 11\n",
    "\n",
    "**True/False:** For PCA, the objective function can equivalently be\n",
    "thought of as (1) variance-maximization or (2) reconstruction\n",
    "error-minimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  True  \n",
    "2.  False\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** The answer is (A).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** This is a fundamental result in PCA. The first\n",
    "principal component maximizes the variance of the projected data:\n",
    "$\\max_{||v||=1} \\text{Var}(Xv)$. Equivalently, it minimizes the\n",
    "reconstruction error: $\\min_{||v||=1} ||X - Xvv^T||_F^2$. These two\n",
    "objectives are mathematically equivalent - maximizing the variance of\n",
    "projections is the same as minimizing the squared distance from the data\n",
    "to its projection onto the principal component.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 12\n",
    "\n",
    "Which of the following activation functions can be used in the output\n",
    "layer of a neural network if we wish to predict the probabilities of $k$\n",
    "classes $\\hat{p} = (p_1, p_2,..., p_k)$ such that sum of $\\hat{p}$ over\n",
    "all $k$ equals to 1? (Assume $k \\ge 2$.)\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Tanh  \n",
    "2.  Leaky ReLU  \n",
    "3.  Sigmoid  \n",
    "4.  Softmax\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** The answer is (D).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** Softmax is the appropriate activation function for\n",
    "multi-class classification because it outputs a probability distribution\n",
    "that sums to 1. The softmax function is defined as\n",
    "$\\text{softmax}(z_i) = \\frac{e^{z_i}}{\\sum_{j=1}^k e^{z_j}}$, which\n",
    "ensures that all outputs are positive and sum to 1. Tanh and Leaky ReLU\n",
    "don’t guarantee this property, and sigmoid is typically used for binary\n",
    "classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 13\n",
    "\n",
    "**True/False:** For decision tree algorithms, small perturbation in the\n",
    "training data can result in large differences in the resulting\n",
    "classifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  True  \n",
    "2.  False\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** The answer is (A).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** Decision trees are highly sensitive to small changes in\n",
    "the training data because they make decisions based on threshold splits\n",
    "at each node. A small change in the data can cause a completely\n",
    "different split to be chosen at a node, which can cascade through the\n",
    "entire tree structure, leading to very different decision boundaries.\n",
    "This is why ensemble methods like random forests are often used to\n",
    "improve stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 14\n",
    "\n",
    "**True/False:** The unfairness with respect to race of a model trained\n",
    "on a dataset can be completely resolved by removing race as a feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  True  \n",
    "2.  False\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** The answer is (B).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** Simply removing race as a feature does not eliminate\n",
    "bias because race can be correlated with other features in the dataset\n",
    "(proxy variables). For example, if race is correlated with zip code,\n",
    "income, or other demographic factors, the model can still learn\n",
    "discriminatory patterns through these proxy variables. True fairness\n",
    "requires more sophisticated approaches like fairness-aware training,\n",
    "data preprocessing, or post-processing techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 15\n",
    "\n",
    "For the following code snippet on the bootstrap algorithm, determine\n",
    "whether it is correct or select the function that is possibly buggy.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "1 import random\n",
    "2\n",
    "3 def sample(data):\n",
    "4     sample = random.sample(data, len(data)) # samples len(data) elements without replacement\n",
    "5     return sample\n",
    "6\n",
    "7 def mean(numbers):\n",
    "8     return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n",
    "9\n",
    "10 def bootstrap(data, num_samples):\n",
    "11     samples = [sample(data) for _ in range(num_samples)]\n",
    "12     sample_means = [mean(sample) for sample in samples]\n",
    "13     return sample_means\n",
    "14\n",
    "15 data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "16 bootstrap_means = bootstrap(data, 10)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Code is correct.  \n",
    "2.  sample function is buggy.  \n",
    "3.  mean function is buggy.  \n",
    "4.  bootstrap function is buggy (assuming sample function and mean\n",
    "    function is correct).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** The answer is (B).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** The `sample` function is buggy because it uses\n",
    "`random.sample()` which samples without replacement, but bootstrap\n",
    "sampling should sample with replacement. Bootstrap samples should allow\n",
    "the same data point to appear multiple times in a single sample. The\n",
    "correct implementation should use `random.choices()` or\n",
    "`numpy.random.choice()` with `replace=True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 16\n",
    "\n",
    "**True/False:** The bootstrap method can be applied to other statistics,\n",
    "not just variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  True  \n",
    "2.  False\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** The answer is (A).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** The bootstrap method is a general resampling technique\n",
    "that can be used to estimate the sampling distribution of any statistic,\n",
    "not just variance. It can be applied to estimate confidence intervals,\n",
    "standard errors, bias, and other properties of estimators for means,\n",
    "medians, regression coefficients, and many other statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 17\n",
    "\n",
    "**True/False:** The cluster centers that are calculated during each\n",
    "iteration of Lloyd’s algorithm are always actual data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  True  \n",
    "2.  False\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** The answer is (B).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** In Lloyd’s algorithm, cluster centers (centroids) are\n",
    "calculated as the mean of all data points assigned to that cluster.\n",
    "These centroids are typically not actual data points from the original\n",
    "dataset, but rather the arithmetic mean of the cluster members. Only in\n",
    "special cases (like when a cluster contains only one data point) would\n",
    "the centroid coincide with an actual data point.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 18\n",
    "\n",
    "What kind of method can be used to tune models and hyperparameter\n",
    "selection so as to optimize the bias-variance tradeoff?\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Bootstrap.  \n",
    "2.  $k$-means.  \n",
    "3.  Cross validation.  \n",
    "4.  All of the above.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** The answer is (C).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** Cross-validation is specifically designed for model\n",
    "selection and hyperparameter tuning to optimize the bias-variance\n",
    "tradeoff. It provides an unbiased estimate of model performance on\n",
    "unseen data, allowing us to compare different model configurations.\n",
    "While bootstrap can be used for some model selection tasks, it’s not the\n",
    "primary tool for hyperparameter tuning. K-means is a clustering\n",
    "algorithm, not a model selection method.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 19\n",
    "\n",
    "**True/False:** The expected error on unseen samples is at least the\n",
    "irreducible error.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  True  \n",
    "2.  False\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** The answer is (A).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** The irreducible error represents the inherent noise in\n",
    "the data that cannot be eliminated by any model. It sets a lower bound\n",
    "on the achievable error rate. The expected error on unseen samples can\n",
    "be decomposed as:\n",
    "$\\text{Expected Error} = \\text{Bias}^2 + \\text{Variance} + \\text{Irreducible Error}$.\n",
    "Since bias and variance are non-negative, the expected error must be at\n",
    "least as large as the irreducible error.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 20\n",
    "\n",
    "Which of the following methods would not help when a model suffers from\n",
    "high bias?\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Add more input features.  \n",
    "2.  Standardizing the data (to have mean 0, variance 1).  \n",
    "3.  Decrease regularization.  \n",
    "4.  Increase the complexity of the hypothesis class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** The answer is (B).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** High bias indicates that the model is too simple to\n",
    "capture the underlying patterns in the data. Standardizing the data\n",
    "(scaling to mean 0, variance 1) doesn’t change the model’s capacity or\n",
    "complexity - it only changes the scale of the features. The other\n",
    "options directly address high bias: adding features increases model\n",
    "capacity, decreasing regularization allows the model to fit the data\n",
    "more closely, and increasing hypothesis class complexity gives the model\n",
    "more flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 21\n",
    "\n",
    "Which of the following would be the most appropriate loss function to\n",
    "use when training a neural network on a multi-class classification\n",
    "problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Mean Absolute Error  \n",
    "2.  Mean Squared Error  \n",
    "3.  Cross Entropy  \n",
    "4.  Hinge loss\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** The answer is (C).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** Cross-entropy loss is the most appropriate for\n",
    "multi-class classification because it measures the difference between\n",
    "the predicted probability distribution and the true distribution. It’s\n",
    "defined as $-\\sum_{i=1}^k y_i \\log(\\hat{y}_i)$ where $y_i$ is the true\n",
    "label and $\\hat{y}_i$ is the predicted probability. Mean Absolute Error\n",
    "and Mean Squared Error are typically used for regression problems, while\n",
    "hinge loss is used for binary classification with SVMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 22\n",
    "\n",
    "Which of the following does not increase the complexity of a neural\n",
    "network?\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Adding more layers  \n",
    "2.  Increasing the hidden layer size  \n",
    "3.  Reducing the strength of the regularizer  \n",
    "4.  Reducing the learning rate\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** The answer is (D).\n",
    "\n",
