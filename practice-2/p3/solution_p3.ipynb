    "If we have $n$ data points and $d$ features, we store $nd$ values in total. We can use principal component analysis to store an approximate version of this dataset in fewer values overall. If we use the first $q$ principal components of this data, how many values do we need to approximate the original demeaned dataset? Justify your answer.\n",

    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is **$qd + qn$**. Here's the detailed breakdown of why this is the correct number of values needed:\n",

    "**PCA Storage Requirements:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Principal Components Storage**: $qd$ values\n",
    "   - We need to store $q$ principal components\n",
    "   - Each principal component is a vector in $\\mathbb{R}^d$\n",
    "   - Total storage: $q \\times d = qd$ values\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Coefficients Storage**: $qn$ values\n",
    "   - For each of the $n$ data points, we need $q$ coefficients\n",
    "   - These coefficients represent how much each data point projects onto each principal component\n",
    "   - Total storage: $n \\times q = qn$ values\n",

    "$$X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**PCA Decomposition:**\n",
    "After centering the data, PCA finds:\n",
    "- Principal components: $V = [v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_q] \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times q}$\n",
    "- Coefficients: $A = [a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n]^T \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times q}$\n",

    "**When PCA Provides Compression:**\n",
    "PCA reduces storage when $qd + qn < nd$, which typically occurs when $q \\ll \\min(n, d)$.\n",

    "**Example:**\n",
    "For $n = 1000$, $d = 100$, $q = 10$:\n",
    "- Original storage: $1000 \\times 100 = 100,000$ values\n",
    "- PCA storage: $10 \\times 100 + 1000 \\times 10 = 1,000 + 10,000 = 11,000$ values\n",
