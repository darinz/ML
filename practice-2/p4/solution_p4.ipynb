    "## Problem 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Both forward and backward passes are a part of the backpropagation algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) True\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) False\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** The solution is (a).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The correct answer is **(a) - True**. Here's the detailed explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Backpropagation Algorithm Components:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Forward Pass:**\n",
    "- Computes the output of the network for given inputs\n",
    "- Propagates activations from input layer to output layer\n",
    "- Calculates the loss/error at the output layer\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Backward Pass:**\n",
    "- Computes gradients of the loss with respect to all parameters\n",
    "- Propagates gradients backward from output layer to input layer\n",
    "- Uses the chain rule to efficiently compute all partial derivatives\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Framework:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Forward Pass:**\n",
    "For a neural network with $L$ layers:\n",
    "$$a^{(l)} = f^{(l)}(W^{(l)}a^{(l-1)} + b^{(l)})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $a^{(l)}$ is the activation at layer $l$\n",
    "- $W^{(l)}$ and $b^{(l)}$ are weights and biases\n",
    "- $f^{(l)}$ is the activation function\n",
    "\n",
    "**Backward Pass:**\n",
    "$$\\delta^{(l)} = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial a^{(l)}} = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial a^{(l+1)}} \\frac{\\partial a^{(l+1)}}{\\partial a^{(l)}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Both Are Essential:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Forward Pass Purpose:**\n",
    "   - Computes predictions: $\\hat{y} = f(x; \\theta)$\n",
    "   - Calculates loss: $L(\\hat{y}, y)$\n",
    "   - Stores intermediate activations for gradient computation\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Backward Pass Purpose:**\n",
    "   - Computes gradients: $\\nabla_\\theta L$\n",
    "   - Updates parameters: $\\theta \\leftarrow \\theta - \\alpha \\nabla_\\theta L$\n",
    "   - Enables learning through gradient descent\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithm Flow:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. Forward Pass:\n",
    "   - Input: x\n",
    "   - Compute: a^(1), a^(2), ..., a^(L)\n",
    "   - Output: ŷ and loss L\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Backward Pass:\n",
    "   - Input: ∂L/∂ŷ\n",
    "   - Compute: ∂L/∂W^(L), ∂L/∂W^(L-1), ..., ∂L/∂W^(1)\n",
    "   - Output: All gradients\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Parameter Update:\n",
    "   - Update: W^(l) ← W^(l) - α ∂L/∂W^(l)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Historical Context:**\n",
    "The term \"backpropagation\" originally referred to the backward pass, but modern usage includes both forward and backward passes as part of the complete algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "Both forward and backward passes are essential components of the backpropagation algorithm, making **(a) True** the correct answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Which of the following is the best option that can be done to reduce a model's bias?\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Add more input features.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Standardize/normalize the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) Add regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "(d) Collect more data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** The solution is (a).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The correct answer is **(a) - Add more input features**. Here's the detailed explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Understanding Model Bias:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition of Bias:**\n",
    "Bias is the difference between the expected prediction of our model and the true value:\n",
    "$$\\text{Bias} = \\mathbb{E}[\\hat{f}(x)] - f(x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\hat{f}(x)$ is our model's prediction and $f(x)$ is the true underlying function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Adding Features Reduces Bias:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Increased Model Capacity:**\n",
    "- More features provide more information to the model\n",
    "- The model can capture more complex patterns in the data\n",
    "- Higher-dimensional feature space allows for more sophisticated decision boundaries\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Mathematical Intuition:**\n",
    "- With more features, the model can represent more complex functions\n",
    "- The hypothesis space becomes larger and more expressive\n",
    "- The model can better approximate the true underlying relationship\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Example:**\n",
    "Consider predicting house prices:\n",
    "- **Low-dimensional model**: Only square footage → limited predictive power\n",
    "- **High-dimensional model**: Square footage + bedrooms + bathrooms + location + age + condition → much better predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Other Options Don't Reduce Bias:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option (b) - Standardize/normalize the data:**\n",
    "- **Effect**: Changes the scale of features, not the model's capacity\n",
    "- **Impact on Bias**: Minimal effect on bias\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Helps with optimization and numerical stability\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option (c) - Add regularization:**\n",
    "- **Effect**: Increases bias by constraining the model\n",
    "- **Impact on Bias**: **Increases bias** (this is the trade-off for reducing variance)\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Prevents overfitting by making the model simpler\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option (d) - Collect more data:**\n",
    "- **Effect**: Reduces variance, not bias\n",
    "- **Impact on Bias**: Minimal effect on bias\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Makes estimates more stable and reliable\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bias-Variance Tradeoff:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship can be expressed as:\n",
    "$$\\text{Expected Error} = \\text{Bias}^2 + \\text{Variance} + \\text{Irreducible Error}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Adding Features:**\n",
    "- **Bias**: Decreases (model becomes more flexible)\n",
    "- **Variance**: May increase (risk of overfitting)\n",
    "- **Total Error**: May decrease if bias reduction outweighs variance increase\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practical Considerations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Add Features:**\n",
    "- Model is underfitting (high bias, low variance)\n",
    "- Domain knowledge suggests important features are missing\n",
    "- Feature engineering can create informative derived features\n",
    "\n",
    "**When Not to Add Features:**\n",
    "- Model is already overfitting (low bias, high variance)\n",
    "- Features are highly correlated (multicollinearity)\n",
    "- Computational cost is prohibitive\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feature Engineering Examples:**\n",
    "- **Polynomial features**: $x^2, x^3, xy$\n",
    "- **Interaction terms**: $x_1 \\times x_2$\n",
    "- **Domain-specific features**: Day of week, season, etc.\n",
    "- **Transformed features**: $\\log(x), \\sqrt{x}$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "Adding more input features is the most direct way to reduce model bias by increasing the model's capacity to capture complex patterns in the data.\n",

    "## Problem 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Draw the maximum margin separating boundary between the hollow and filled points.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/q3.png\" width=\"450px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "A Cartesian coordinate system is shown with an x-axis ranging from 0 to 4 and a y-axis ranging from 0 to 4. Grid lines are present at 0.5 unit intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of points plotted:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hollow points (circles):**\n",
    "- $(1, 2)$\n",
    "- $(2, 3)$\n",

    "- $(2, 0.5)$\n",
    "- $(2, 1)$\n",
    "- $(3, 0.5)$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** The solution for part 2 is (red = actual, purple=acceptable):\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/q3_answer.png\" width=\"350px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "A second Cartesian coordinate system is shown, identical in scale and points to the first.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the hollow and filled points are plotted as described above.\n",
    "\n",
    "A red line, representing the \"actual\" maximum margin separating boundary, is drawn. This line appears to pass through approximately $(0, 0.5)$, $(1, 1)$, $(2, 1.5)$, $(3, 2)$, and $(4, 2.5)$. The equation of this line can be approximated as $y = 0.5x + 0.5$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A purple shaded band, representing the \"acceptable\" region for the separating boundary, surrounds the red line. The lower boundary of this purple band appears to pass through approximately $(0, 0.25)$, $(1, 0.75)$, $(2, 1.25)$, $(3, 1.75)$, and $(4, 2.25)$, which can be approximated as $y = 0.5x + 0.25$. The upper boundary of the purple band appears to pass through approximately $(0, 0.75)$, $(1, 1.25)$, $(2, 1.75)$, $(3, 2.25)$, and $(4, 2.75)$, which can be approximated as $y = 0.5x + 0.75$. The red line is centered within this purple band.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Key Insight:**\n",
    "You can train and evaluate a kernelized SVM in polynomial time **even if** $\\phi(x)$ runs in exponential time or is computationally expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Is Possible:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. The Kernel Trick:**\n",
    "- Kernelized SVM never explicitly computes $\\phi(x)$\n",
    "- Instead, it works directly with the kernel function $K(x_i, x_j) = \\langle \\phi(x_i), \\phi(x_j) \\rangle$\n",
    "- The kernel function can be computed efficiently without computing $\\phi(x)$\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Mathematical Framework:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Primal Form (with explicit feature mapping):**\n",
    "$$\\min_{w,b} \\frac{1}{2}||w||^2 + C\\sum_{i=1}^n \\xi_i$$\n",

    "$$\\text{subject to } 0 \\leq \\alpha_i \\leq C, \\sum_{i=1}^n \\alpha_i y_i = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Computational Complexity:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Training:**\n",
    "- **With kernel trick**: $O(n^3)$ for solving the quadratic programming problem\n",
    "- **Without kernel trick**: $O(d^3)$ where $d$ is the dimension of $\\phi(x)$\n",
    "- If $d$ is exponential, the primal form becomes intractable\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prediction:**\n",
    "- **With kernel trick**: $O(n_s)$ where $n_s$ is the number of support vectors\n",
    "- **Without kernel trick**: $O(d)$ for computing $w^T \\phi(x)$\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Examples of Efficient Kernels:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Polynomial Kernel:**\n",
    "$$K(x_i, x_j) = (x_i^T x_j + c)^d$$\n",
    "- **Feature mapping**: $\\phi(x)$ has $\\binom{d + n}{d}$ dimensions (exponential in $d$)\n",

    "- **SVM training**: $O(n^3)$ time (independent of $d$)\n",
    "\n",
    "**RBF Kernel:**\n",

    "- **Kernel computation**: $O(n)$ time\n",
    "- **SVM training**: $O(n^3)$ time\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Why the Statement is False:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The statement claims that polynomial-time training/evaluation requires polynomial-time feature mapping. However:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Training**: Uses dual form with kernel matrix, complexity $O(n^3)$\n",
    "- **Evaluation**: Uses kernel function directly, complexity $O(n_s)$\n",
    "- **Feature mapping**: Never computed explicitly\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Practical Implications:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages of Kernel Trick:**\n",
    "- Can work with infinite-dimensional feature spaces\n",
    "- Computationally efficient for many kernels\n",
    "- Enables non-linear decision boundaries\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations:**\n",
    "- Memory requirements: $O(n^2)$ for kernel matrix\n",
    "- Training time: $O(n^3)$ becomes prohibitive for large datasets\n",

    "\n",
    "Consider a data matrix $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$. What is the smallest upper bound on $\\operatorname{rank}(X)$ which holds for every $X$?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** $\\operatorname{rank}(X) \\le \\min(n, d)$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is **$\\operatorname{rank}(X) \\le \\min(n, d)$**. Here's the detailed explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Matrix Rank Fundamentals:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition of Rank:**\n",
    "The rank of a matrix $X$ is the maximum number of linearly independent rows (or columns) in the matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Properties:**\n",
    "1. **Row rank = Column rank**: For any matrix, the number of linearly independent rows equals the number of linearly independent columns\n",
    "2. **Rank bounds**: The rank cannot exceed the number of rows or columns\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Proof:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Row Rank Bound:**\n",
    "- The rank cannot exceed the number of rows $n$\n",
    "- If rank $> n$, we would have more than $n$ linearly independent rows, which is impossible\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Column Rank Bound:**\n",
    "- The rank cannot exceed the number of columns $d$\n",
    "- If rank $> d$, we would have more than $d$ linearly independent columns, which is impossible\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Combined Bound:**\n",
    "Since rank $\\leq n$ AND rank $\\leq d$, we have:\n",
    "$$\\operatorname{rank}(X) \\leq \\min(n, d)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Case 1: $n < d$ (more columns than rows)**\n",
    "- Example: $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3 \\times 5}$\n",
    "- Maximum possible rank: $\\min(3, 5) = 3$\n",
    "- The rank cannot exceed 3 because there are only 3 rows\n",
    "\n",
    "**Case 2: $d < n$ (more rows than columns)**\n",
    "- Example: $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{5 \\times 3}$\n",
    "- Maximum possible rank: $\\min(5, 3) = 3$\n",
    "- The rank cannot exceed 3 because there are only 3 columns\n",
    "\n",
    "**Case 3: $n = d$ (square matrix)**\n",
    "- Example: $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{4 \\times 4}$\n",
    "- Maximum possible rank: $\\min(4, 4) = 4$\n",
    "- The rank cannot exceed 4\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This is the Smallest Upper Bound:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Tightness:**\n",
    "- For any $n$ and $d$, there exist matrices that achieve rank $= \\min(n, d)$\n",
    "- Example: Identity matrix padded with zeros\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. No Smaller Bound:**\n",
    "- If we claimed rank $\\leq k$ where $k < \\min(n, d)$, we would be wrong\n",
    "- There exist matrices with rank $= \\min(n, d)$\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Universality:**\n",
    "- This bound holds for **every** matrix $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$\n",
    "- It doesn't depend on the specific values in the matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Verification:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Full Rank Matrix:**\n",
    "Consider a matrix with $\\min(n, d)$ linearly independent rows/columns:\n",
    "- If $n \\leq d$: Take first $n$ columns of identity matrix, pad with zeros\n",
    "- If $d \\leq n$: Take first $d$ rows of identity matrix, pad with zeros\n",
    "- This matrix has rank $= \\min(n, d)$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rank Deficiency:**\n",
    "Any matrix with fewer than $\\min(n, d)$ linearly independent rows/columns will have rank $< \\min(n, d)$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practical Implications:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Dimensionality Reduction:**\n",
    "- PCA can reduce dimensions to at most $\\min(n, d)$\n",
    "- SVD produces at most $\\min(n, d)$ singular values\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Linear Independence:**\n",
    "- Maximum number of linearly independent features: $\\min(n, d)$\n",
    "- Maximum number of linearly independent samples: $\\min(n, d)$\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Computational Efficiency:**\n",
    "- Matrix operations are most efficient when rank is close to $\\min(n, d)$\n",
    "- Low-rank matrices can be compressed efficiently\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "The smallest upper bound on the rank of any matrix $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$ is **$\\operatorname{rank}(X) \\leq \\min(n, d)$**.\n",
