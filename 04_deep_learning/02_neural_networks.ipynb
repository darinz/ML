    "\n",
    "Neural networks represent one of the most powerful and flexible approaches to machine learning, capable of learning complex patterns and relationships from data. At their core, neural networks are computational models inspired by biological neural systems, consisting of interconnected processing units (neurons) organized in layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Are Neural Networks? - The Computational Revolution\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks are mathematical models that can approximate any continuous function given sufficient capacity. They consist of:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input Layer**: Receives the raw data\n",
    "2. **Hidden Layers**: Process and transform the data through non-linear operations\n",
    "3. **Output Layer**: Produces the final prediction or classification\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-World Analogy: The Factory Assembly Line**\n",
    "Think of neural networks like a sophisticated factory assembly line:\n",
    "- **Input Layer**: Raw materials arrive (data)\n",

    "- **Learning**: The chef improves the recipe based on taste tests (training)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Intuition: Function Composition**\n",
    "A neural network is essentially a composition of simple functions:\n",
    "```math\n",
    "f(x) = f_L \\circ f_{L-1} \\circ \\cdots \\circ f_1(x)\n",
    "```\n",
