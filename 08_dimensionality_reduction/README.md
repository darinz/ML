# Dimensionality Reduction

Dimensionality reduction is a fundamental concept in machine learning and data analysis. It refers to techniques that reduce the number of variables (features) in a dataset while preserving as much relevant information as possible. This makes data easier to visualize, interpret, and use for downstream tasks such as classification, clustering, or regression. Dimensionality reduction can also help remove noise and redundancy, speed up algorithms, and reveal hidden structure in the data.

This folder covers two of the most important linear dimensionality reduction techniques with comprehensive theoretical foundations and practical implementations:

- **Principal Components Analysis (PCA):** Finds new axes (principal components) that maximize variance and decorrelate the data. Useful for visualization, compression, noise reduction, and feature extraction.
- **Independent Components Analysis (ICA):** Goes beyond PCA by finding statistically independent components in the data. Especially useful for separating mixed signals (e.g., the cocktail party problem) and blind source separation.
