# Independent Components Analysis (ICA)

## Introduction and Motivation

Independent Components Analysis (ICA) is a powerful technique for separating a set of mixed signals into their original, independent sources. While Principal Components Analysis (PCA) finds new axes that maximize variance and decorrelate the data, ICA goes further: it tries to find components that are **statistically independent**, not just uncorrelated. This makes ICA especially useful for problems where the observed data is a mixture of underlying signals, and we want to recover those original signals.

### What is Statistical Independence?

Two random variables $` X `$ and $` Y `$ are **statistically independent** if their joint probability density function factors into the product of their marginal densities:

```math
p_{X,Y}(x,y) = p_X(x) \cdot p_Y(y)
```

This is a much stronger condition than being uncorrelated. Uncorrelated variables have $` \text{Cov}(X,Y) = 0 `$, but independent variables have $` p_{X,Y}(x,y) = p_X(x) \cdot p_Y(y) `$.

**Key Insight:** Independence implies uncorrelation, but uncorrelation does not imply independence. ICA seeks independence, which is why it can separate signals that PCA cannot.

### The Fundamental Problem

In many real-world scenarios, we observe mixtures of signals rather than the original signals themselves. The challenge is to recover the original, independent sources from these mixtures.

**Mathematical Formulation:** We observe $` x = As `$ where:
- $` s `$ are the original independent sources
- $` A `$ is an unknown mixing matrix
- $` x `$ are the observed mixtures

Our goal is to find $` W = A^{-1} `$ such that $` s = Wx `$.

## The Cocktail Party Problem: An Intuitive Example

### The Scenario

Imagine you are at a lively cocktail party. There are several people (say, $` d `$ speakers) all talking at once, and you place $` d `$ microphones around the room. Each microphone records a different mixture of all the voices, depending on how close it is to each speaker. The challenge: can you take the recordings from the microphones and separate out each individual speaker's voice?

### Why This Matters

This is not just a party trick! Similar problems arise in:

- **Brain imaging:** EEG/MEG sensors record mixtures of brain signals from different neural sources
- **Finance:** Observed stock prices are mixtures of underlying market factors
- **Image processing:** Pixels may be mixtures of different sources of light or color channels
- **Audio processing:** Multiple audio sources mixed together
- **Biomedical signals:** ECG, EMG, and other physiological signals often contain mixtures

### The Mathematical Model

As a motivating example, consider the "cocktail party problem." Here, $` d `$ speakers are speaking simultaneously at a party, and any microphone placed in the room records only an overlapping combination of the $` d `$ speakers' voices. But let's say we have $` d `$ different microphones placed in the room, and because each microphone is a different distance from each of the speakers, it records a different combination of the speakers' voices. Using these microphone recordings, can we separate out the original $` d `$ speakers' speech signals?

### Formal Problem Statement

To formalize this problem, we imagine that there is some data $` s \in \mathbb{R}^d `$ that is generated via $` d `$ independent sources. What we observe is:

```math
x = As
```

where $` A `$ is an unknown square matrix called the **mixing matrix**. Repeated observations gives us a dataset $` \{x^{(i)}; i = 1, \ldots, n\} `$, and our goal is to recover the sources $` s^{(i)} `$ that had generated our data ($` x^{(i)} = As^{(i)} `$).

### Interpretation in the Cocktail Party Context

In our cocktail party problem:
- $` s^{(i)} `$ is an $` d `$-dimensional vector, and $` s_j^{(i)} `$ is the sound that speaker $` j `$ was uttering at time $` i `$
- $` x^{(i)} `$ is an $` d `$-dimensional vector, and $` x_j^{(i)} `$ is the acoustic reading recorded by microphone $` j `$ at time $` i `$

### The Unmixing Matrix

Let $` W = A^{-1} `$ be the **unmixing matrix**. Our goal is to find $` W `$, so that given our microphone recordings $` x^{(i)} `$, we can recover the sources by computing $` s^{(i)} = W x^{(i)} `$.

For notational convenience, we also let $` w_i^T `$ denote the $` i `$-th row of $` W `$, so that:

```math
W = \begin{bmatrix}
    w_1^T \\
    \vdots \\
    w_d^T
\end{bmatrix}
```

Thus, $` w_i \in \mathbb{R}^d `$, and the $` j `$-th source can be recovered as $` s_j^{(i)} = w_j^T x^{(i)} `$.

## ICA Ambiguities and Constraints

### Fundamental Ambiguities

There are some fundamental ambiguities in ICA that make the problem challenging:

#### 1. Permutation Ambiguity

The order of the recovered sources cannot be determined. Any permutation of the sources is equally valid because we don't know which source corresponds to which original signal.

**Mathematical Formulation:** If $` P `$ is a permutation matrix, then $` W' = PW `$ and $` s' = Ps `$ give an equally valid solution.

#### 2. Scaling Ambiguity

The scale of each recovered source cannot be determined. Multiplying a source by a constant and dividing the corresponding column of $` A `$ by the same constant leaves $` x `$ unchanged.

**Mathematical Formulation:** If $` D `$ is a diagonal matrix, then $` W' = DW `$ and $` s' = D^{-1}s `$ give an equally valid solution.

#### 3. Sign Ambiguity

The sign of each source is arbitrary. Flipping the sign of a source and the corresponding column of $` A `$ leaves $` x `$ unchanged.

**Mathematical Formulation:** This is a special case of scaling ambiguity where the diagonal elements of $` D `$ are Â±1.

### Why These Ambiguities Don't Matter

These ambiguities do not matter for most applications, as we are usually interested in the independent sources themselves, not their order or scale. What matters is that we recover the underlying independent components.

### The Gaussian Constraint

**Critical Limitation:** ICA only works when the sources are **non-Gaussian**. If the sources are Gaussian, the mixing is not identifiable due to the rotational symmetry of the Gaussian distribution.

**Intuition:** Gaussian distributions are rotationally symmetric, so rotating a mixture of Gaussians gives another valid mixture. This means there's no unique way to separate them.

**Mathematical Justification:** For Gaussian sources, the joint distribution is completely characterized by the covariance matrix, which only captures second-order statistics (correlations). ICA needs higher-order statistics to identify independent components.

## Mathematical Foundation: Densities and Linear Transformations

### The Change of Variables Formula

To understand how ICA works, we need to understand how probability densities transform under linear transformations.

Suppose a random variable $` s `$ is drawn according to some density $` p_s(s) `$. For simplicity, assume for now that $` s \in \mathbb{R} `$ is a real number. Now, let the random variable $` x `$ be defined according to $` x = As `$ (here, $` x \in \mathbb{R} `$, $` A \in \mathbb{R} `$). Let $` p_x `$ be the density of $` x `$. What is $` p_x(x) `$?

### The Incorrect Intuition

Let $` W = A^{-1} `$. To calculate the "probability" of a particular value of $` x `$, it is tempting to compute $` s = Wx `$, then evaluate $` p_s `$ at that point, and conclude that "$` p_x(x) = p_s(Wx) `$". However, **this is incorrect**.

### A Counterexample

For example, let $` s \sim \text{Uniform}[0, 1] `$, so $` p_s(s) = \mathbf{1}\{0 \leq s \leq 1\} `$. Now, let $` A = 2 `$, so $` x = 2s `$. Clearly, $` x `$ is distributed uniformly in the interval $` [0, 2] `$. Thus, its density is given by $` p_x(x) = (0.5)\mathbf{1}\{0 \leq x \leq 2\} `$. This does not equal $` p_s(Wx) `$, where $` W = 0.5 = A^{-1} `$.

### The Correct Formula

Instead, the correct formula is $` p_x(x) = p_s(Wx)|W| `$.

**Intuition:** The factor $` |W| `$ accounts for how the transformation stretches or compresses the probability mass.

### Generalization to Multiple Dimensions

More generally, if $` s `$ is a vector-valued distribution with density $` p_s `$, and $` x = As `$ for a square, invertible matrix $` A `$, then the density of $` x `$ is given by:

```math
p_x(x) = p_s(Wx) \cdot |W|
```

where $` W = A^{-1} `$ and $` |W| `$ is the absolute value of the determinant of $` W `$.

**Key Insight:** This formula is crucial for ICA because it tells us how the joint density of the sources relates to the joint density of the observations.

## Data Preprocessing: Whitening

Before applying ICA, it is common to preprocess the data by whitening (decorrelating and scaling) the mixtures. This step is not strictly necessary for all ICA algorithms, but it often improves convergence and interpretability.

### What is Whitening?

Whitening transforms the data so that it has:
1. **Zero mean:** $` \mathbb{E}[x] = 0 `$
2. **Unit covariance:** $` \mathbb{E}[xx^T] = I `$

### Why Whitening Helps

1. **Simplifies the Problem:** After whitening, the mixing matrix becomes orthogonal, reducing the number of parameters to estimate
2. **Improves Convergence:** Many ICA algorithms converge faster on whitened data
3. **Numerical Stability:** Prevents numerical issues that can arise with ill-conditioned covariance matrices

### Mathematical Implementation

The whitening transformation can be computed using PCA:

1. **Center the data:** $` x_{\text{centered}} = x - \mu `$
2. **Compute covariance:** $` \Sigma = \mathbb{E}[x_{\text{centered}} x_{\text{centered}}^T] `$
3. **Eigenvalue decomposition:** $` \Sigma = EDE^T `$
4. **Whitening transformation:** $` x_{\text{white}} = ED^{-1/2}E^T x_{\text{centered}} `$

**Result:** $` \mathbb{E}[x_{\text{white}} x_{\text{white}}^T] = I `$

### Geometric Interpretation

Whitening can be thought of as:
1. **Centering:** Moving the data to the origin
2. **Rotating:** Aligning the data with the principal axes
3. **Scaling:** Making all directions have unit variance

After whitening, the data looks like a "white" (uncorrelated) cloud of points.

## The ICA Algorithm: Maximum Likelihood Approach

### The Likelihood Function

We suppose that the distribution of each source $` s_j `$ is given by a density $` p_s `$, and that the joint distribution of the sources $` s `$ is given by:

```math
p(s) = \prod_{j=1}^d p_s(s_j)
```

This assumes that the sources are independent. Using our formulas from the previous section, this implies the following density on $` x = As = W^{-1}s `$:

```math
p(x) = \prod_{j=1}^d p_s(w_j^T x) \cdot |W|
```

### Choosing a Source Density

To specify a density for the $` s_i `$'s, all we need to do is to specify some cumulative distribution function (CDF) for it. A CDF has to be a monotonic function that increases from zero to one. A common choice is the sigmoid function $` g(s) = 1/(1 + e^{-s}) `$. Hence, $` p_s(s) = g'(s) `$.

**Why Sigmoid?** The sigmoid function is smooth, differentiable, and has a nice shape that works well for many types of signals.

### The Log-Likelihood

The square matrix $` W `$ is the parameter in our model. Given a training set $` \{x^{(i)}; i = 1, \ldots, n\} `$, the log likelihood is given by:

```math
\ell(W) = \sum_{i=1}^n \left( \sum_{j=1}^d \log g'(w_j^T x^{(i)}) + \log |W| \right)
```

### Optimization via Gradient Ascent

We would like to maximize this in terms of $` W `$. By taking derivatives and using the fact that $` \nabla_W |W| = |W| (W^{-1})^T `$, we can derive a stochastic gradient ascent learning rule.

For a training example $` x^{(i)} `$, the update rule is:

```math
W := W + \alpha \left( \begin{bmatrix}
1 - 2g(w_1^T x^{(i)}) \\
1 - 2g(w_2^T x^{(i)}) \\
\vdots \\
1 - 2g(w_d^T x^{(i)})
\end{bmatrix} x^{(i)T} + (W^T)^{-1} \right)
```

where $` \alpha `$ is the learning rate.

### Understanding the Update Rule

The update rule has two terms:

1. **Data term:** $` (1 - 2g(w_j^T x^{(i)})) x^{(i)T} `$ - This encourages the algorithm to find directions that make the sources more non-Gaussian
2. **Regularization term:** $` (W^T)^{-1} `$ - This prevents the unmixing matrix from becoming singular

### After Convergence

After the algorithm converges, we then compute $` s^{(i)} = W x^{(i)} `$ to recover the original sources.

## Alternative ICA Algorithms

### FastICA

FastICA is a popular alternative to gradient-based methods that uses a fixed-point iteration scheme. It's generally faster and more robust than gradient ascent.

**Key Idea:** Instead of gradient ascent, FastICA uses a fixed-point iteration that directly finds the independent components.

**Advantages:**
- Faster convergence
- More robust to initialization
- Better numerical stability

### JADE (Joint Approximate Diagonalization of Eigenmatrices)

JADE is another ICA algorithm that works by diagonalizing cumulant matrices.

**Key Idea:** JADE finds the unmixing matrix by diagonalizing fourth-order cumulant matrices.

**Advantages:**
- Works well with many types of source distributions
- Good theoretical properties
- Robust to noise

### Infomax ICA

Infomax ICA maximizes the mutual information between the inputs and outputs of a neural network.

**Key Idea:** Maximize the information flow through a neural network with sigmoid activation functions.

**Advantages:**
- Information-theoretic foundation
- Works well with natural signals
- Good biological plausibility

## Practical Considerations

### Choosing the Number of Components

**Determining $` d `$:**
1. **Known number of sources:** Use domain knowledge
2. **Eigenvalue analysis:** Look for a drop-off in eigenvalues after whitening
3. **Cross-validation:** Try different values and evaluate separation quality
4. **Information criteria:** Use AIC or BIC to balance model complexity and fit

### Assessing Separation Quality

**Metrics:**
1. **Signal-to-Interference Ratio (SIR):** Measures how well sources are separated
2. **Correlation analysis:** Check that recovered sources are uncorrelated
3. **Visual inspection:** Plot the recovered sources and check for meaningful patterns
4. **Domain-specific metrics:** Use metrics relevant to your application

### Handling Non-Stationary Sources

**Challenges:**
- Sources may change over time
- Mixing matrix may be time-varying
- Number of sources may be unknown

**Solutions:**
- Use sliding windows
- Adaptive ICA algorithms
- Online learning approaches

### Computational Complexity

**Time Complexity:** $` O(nd^2) `$ per iteration
- $` O(nd) `$ for computing projections
- $` O(d^2) `$ for matrix operations

**Space Complexity:** $` O(nd + d^2) `$
- $` O(nd) `$ for storing data
- $` O(d^2) `$ for storing unmixing matrix

## Summary

Independent Components Analysis is a powerful technique for separating mixed signals into their original, independent sources. Key points:

1. **Goal:** Find statistically independent components, not just uncorrelated ones
2. **Assumption:** Sources must be non-Gaussian and linearly mixed
3. **Method:** Maximize likelihood or use specialized algorithms like FastICA
4. **Applications:** Brain signal processing, audio separation, image processing, finance
5. **Challenges:** Ambiguities, computational complexity, assumptions about source distributions

The key insight is that by exploiting the non-Gaussian nature of the sources, ICA can separate signals that other methods like PCA cannot. This makes it particularly valuable for applications where the goal is to recover the original, independent sources from their mixtures.

**Remark:** When writing down the likelihood of the data, we implicitly assumed that the $` x^{(i)} `$'s were independent of each other (for different values of $` i `$; note this issue is different from whether the different coordinates of $` x^{(i)} `$ are independent), so that the likelihood of the training set was given by $` \prod_i p(x^{(i)}; W) `$. This assumption is clearly incorrect for speech data and other time series where the $` x^{(i)} `$'s are dependent, but it can be shown that having correlated training examples will not hurt the performance of the algorithm if we have sufficient data. However, for problems where successive training examples are correlated, when implementing stochastic gradient ascent, it sometimes helps accelerate convergence if we visit training examples in a randomly permuted order. (I.e., run stochastic gradient ascent on a randomly shuffled copy of the training set.)
