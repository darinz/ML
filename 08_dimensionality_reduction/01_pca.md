# Principal Components Analysis (PCA)

## The Big Picture: Why Dimensionality Reduction Matters

**The High-Dimensional Data Challenge:**
Imagine trying to understand a complex object by looking at it from thousands of different angles simultaneously. Each angle gives you a piece of information, but most of these pieces are redundant or irrelevant. This is exactly what happens with high-dimensional data - we have so many features that it becomes impossible to see the underlying patterns.

**The Intuitive Analogy:**
Think of the difference between:
- **High-dimensional data**: Like trying to describe a person using 1000 different measurements (height, weight, every pixel of their photo, every sound they make, etc.)
- **Low-dimensional representation**: Like describing the same person with just a few key characteristics (tall, athletic, friendly)

**Why Dimensionality Reduction Matters:**
- **Pattern discovery**: Reveals hidden structure in complex data
- **Computational efficiency**: Makes algorithms faster and more practical
- **Visualization**: Allows us to see data in 2D or 3D
- **Noise reduction**: Removes irrelevant variations
- **Overfitting prevention**: Reduces model complexity

### The Key Insight

**From Complexity to Simplicity:**
- **High dimensions**: Data scattered across many features, hard to understand
- **Low dimensions**: Data concentrated in few meaningful directions
- **PCA**: Finds the most important directions automatically

**The Information Preservation Principle:**
- **Goal**: Keep the most important information while discarding the rest
- **Strategy**: Find directions that capture maximum variance
- **Result**: Simple representation that preserves essential structure

## Introduction and Motivation

In modern data analysis and machine learning, we often encounter datasets with a large number of features (dimensions). For example, an image with 100x100 pixels has 10,000 features, and a dataset of cars might record dozens of attributes for each vehicle. However, not all of these features are equally important or independent—many are correlated or even redundant. This can make data analysis, visualization, and modeling more difficult, a phenomenon sometimes called the **"curse of dimensionality."**

**The Data Complexity Problem:**
- **Feature explosion**: Modern datasets have hundreds or thousands of features
- **Redundancy**: Many features measure the same underlying phenomenon
- **Noise**: Some features contain mostly irrelevant information
- **Correlation**: Features often depend on each other in complex ways

**The Analysis Challenge:**
- **Visualization**: Can't plot data with more than 3 dimensions
- **Computation**: Algorithms become slow with many features
- **Interpretation**: Hard to understand relationships between many variables
- **Overfitting**: Models can memorize noise in high-dimensional spaces

### What is the Curse of Dimensionality?

The curse of dimensionality refers to various phenomena that arise when analyzing and organizing data in high-dimensional spaces. As the number of dimensions increases, the volume of the space increases so fast that the available data becomes sparse. This sparsity is problematic for any method that requires statistical significance. In high dimensions, all data points become equidistant from each other, making distance-based algorithms less effective.

**The Dimensionality Curse Explained:**
- **Volume explosion**: Space volume grows exponentially with dimensions
- **Data sparsity**: Available data becomes thinly spread
- **Distance collapse**: All points become equally distant
- **Statistical problems**: Need exponentially more data for same confidence

**The Volume Explosion Analogy:**
- **1D**: Line segment - easy to fill with data points
- **2D**: Square - need more data to cover the area
- **3D**: Cube - even more data needed
- **100D**: Hypercube - virtually impossible to fill meaningfully

**Key problems:**
- **Data sparsity:** In high dimensions, data points become increasingly isolated
- **Computational complexity:** Many algorithms scale poorly with dimension
- **Overfitting:** Models can easily memorize noise in high-dimensional spaces
- **Visualization difficulty:** Humans can only easily visualize up to 3 dimensions

**The Distance Collapse Problem:**
- **Low dimensions**: Points can be close or far apart
- **High dimensions**: All points become approximately equidistant
- **Why this happens**: Volume grows faster than data can fill it
- **Impact**: Distance-based algorithms (k-NN, clustering) become ineffective

### What is PCA?

Principal Components Analysis (PCA) is a powerful technique for reducing the number of dimensions in a dataset while preserving as much of the original information (variance) as possible. By finding new axes (directions) in the data that capture the most variation, PCA allows us to:

- **Simplify complex datasets:** Make them easier to visualize and interpret
- **Remove redundancy and noise:** Eliminate correlated features
- **Speed up algorithms:** Reduce computational complexity
- **Reveal hidden patterns:** Uncover underlying structure in the data
- **Prevent overfitting:** Reduce model complexity

**The PCA Transformation:**
- **Input**: High-dimensional data with many features
- **Process**: Find directions of maximum variance
- **Output**: Low-dimensional representation preserving most information
- **Result**: Simple, interpretable, efficient data representation

### Intuitive Understanding

**The 3D to 2D Analogy:** Imagine you have a cloud of points in 3D space, but all the points lie close to a flat plane. Instead of describing each point with three coordinates (x, y, z), you could describe it almost as well with just two coordinates on that plane. PCA finds the best-fitting plane (or line, or higher-dimensional subspace) for your data, so you can represent it with fewer numbers without losing much information.

**The Flashlight Analogy:** Think of your data as a cloud of points in space. If you shine a flashlight on this cloud, the shadow on the wall is a projection. PCA finds the direction to shine the flashlight so that the shadow is as spread out (has maximum variance) as possible.

**The Pancake Analogy:**
- **Data cloud**: Like a pancake floating in 3D space
- **Different views**: From different angles, the pancake looks different
- **PCA goal**: Find the angle where the pancake looks widest
- **Result**: Best 2D view of the 3D pancake

**The Compass Analogy:**
- **Data**: Like a compass needle that points in many directions
- **PCA**: Finds the main direction the compass points
- **First component**: The primary direction of variation
- **Second component**: The next most important direction (perpendicular to first)

### Mathematical Foundation

PCA is computationally efficient because it requires only an eigenvector calculation. The mathematical foundation rests on linear algebra, specifically:

1. **Eigenvalue decomposition** of the covariance matrix
2. **Orthogonal transformations** that preserve distances
3. **Variance maximization** under constraints

**The Mathematical Journey:**
- **Data**: Collection of points in high-dimensional space
- **Covariance**: Matrix describing how features vary together
- **Eigenvectors**: Directions of maximum variance
- **Eigenvalues**: Amount of variance in each direction
- **Projection**: Mapping data onto principal components

## Understanding the Data Preprocessing

### The Big Picture: Why Normalization Matters

**The Scale Problem:**
Imagine comparing the importance of a person's height (measured in centimeters, values 150-200) with their number of children (values 0-5). Without normalization, height would dominate the analysis simply because its values are larger, even though number of children might be more important for understanding family structure.

**The Unit Problem:**
- **Height**: Could be measured in inches, centimeters, or meters
- **Weight**: Could be measured in pounds, kilograms, or grams
- **Speed**: Could be measured in mph, km/h, or m/s
- **Without normalization**: The choice of units would determine which features are "important"

**The Centering Problem:**
- **Raw data**: Points scattered around arbitrary locations
- **Centered data**: Points centered around the origin
- **Why center**: Makes the mathematics of PCA much simpler and more intuitive

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Automobile Dataset

Suppose we are given a dataset $` x^{(i)}; i = 1, \ldots, n `$ of attributes of $` n `$ different types of automobiles, such as their maximum speed, turn radius, engine power, fuel efficiency, and so on. Let $` x^{(i)} \in \mathbb{R}^d `$ for each $` i `$ ($` d \ll n `$).

**The Redundancy Problem:** Unknown to us, two different attributes—some $` x_i `$ and $` x_j `$—respectively give a car's maximum speed measured in miles per hour, and the maximum speed measured in kilometers per hour. These two attributes are therefore almost linearly dependent, up to only small differences introduced by rounding off to the nearest mph or kph. Thus, the data really lies approximately on an $` d-1 `$ dimensional subspace.

**The Redundancy Intuition:**
- **Two features**: Speed in mph and speed in km/h
- **Relationship**: km/h ≈ 1.6 × mph (linear relationship)
- **Redundancy**: One feature can be predicted from the other
- **PCA solution**: Find that these features lie along one direction

**The Question:** How can we automatically detect, and perhaps remove, this redundancy?

**The Detection Process:**
1. **Compute correlations**: Find highly correlated feature pairs
2. **Identify redundancy**: Features that are nearly linearly dependent
3. **PCA solution**: Automatically finds these redundant directions
4. **Dimensionality reduction**: Represent both features with one component

### Example 2: RC Helicopter Pilots

Consider a dataset resulting from a survey of pilots for radio-controlled helicopters, where $` x_1^{(i)} `$ is a measure of the piloting skill of pilot $` i `$, and $` x_2^{(i)} `$ captures how much he/she enjoys flying.

**The Correlation:** Because RC helicopters are very difficult to fly, only the most committed students, ones that truly enjoy flying, become good pilots. So, the two attributes $` x_1 `$ and $` x_2 `$ are strongly correlated.

**The Latent Variable:** We might posit that the data actually lies along some diagonal axis (the $` u_1 `$ direction) capturing the intrinsic piloting "karma" of a person, with only a small amount of noise lying off this axis.

**The Latent Variable Intuition:**
- **Observed features**: Skill level and enjoyment level
- **Hidden variable**: "Piloting karma" - natural talent + motivation
- **Correlation**: Good pilots tend to enjoy flying, bad pilots tend to dislike it
- **PCA discovery**: Finds the underlying "karma" direction

**The Question:** How can we automatically compute this $` u_1 `$ direction?

**The Discovery Process:**
1. **Data collection**: Measure skill and enjoyment for many pilots
2. **Correlation analysis**: Find that skill and enjoyment are correlated
3. **PCA computation**: Automatically finds the diagonal direction
4. **Interpretation**: The diagonal represents "piloting karma"

## Data Preprocessing: Normalization

Before applying PCA, it is standard practice to preprocess the data by normalizing each feature so that it has mean 0 and variance 1. This step is crucial for several reasons:

### Why Normalize?

1. **Equal footing for all features:** If one feature (e.g., height in centimeters) has much larger values than another (e.g., number of children), it can dominate the analysis, even if it is not more important. Normalization ensures that all features contribute equally.

2. **Removes bias from units:** Features measured in different units (e.g., miles per hour vs. kilometers per hour) are made comparable.

3. **Centers the data:** Subtracting the mean ensures that the data is centered at the origin, which is important for the mathematics of PCA.

4. **Variance scaling:** Dividing by the standard deviation ensures that each feature has unit variance, so PCA does not favor features with larger natural variability.

**The Normalization Intuition:**
- **Scale problem**: Features with larger values dominate the analysis
- **Unit problem**: Choice of units affects feature importance
- **Centering**: Moves data to origin for simpler mathematics
- **Scaling**: Makes all features equally important

**The Fair Comparison Principle:**
- **Before normalization**: Height (150-200) dominates age (0-100)
- **After normalization**: Both features have equal influence
- **Result**: PCA finds truly important directions, not just directions of large-scale features

### Mathematical Definition

For a feature vector $` x = [x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_d]^T `$, the normalized version $` z = [z_1, z_2, \ldots, z_d]^T `$ is computed as:

```math
z_i = \frac{x_i - \mu_i}{\sigma_i}
```

where:
- $` \mu_i = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{j=1}^n x_i^{(j)} `$ is the mean of feature $` i `$
- $` \sigma_i = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{j=1}^n (x_i^{(j)} - \mu_i)^2} `$ is the standard deviation of feature $` i `$

**The Normalization Formula Explained:**
- **Centering**: $` x_i - \mu_i `$ moves data to have mean zero
- **Scaling**: $` \frac{x_i - \mu_i}{\sigma_i} `$ makes variance equal to one
- **Result**: All features have mean 0 and variance 1

**The Z-score Interpretation:**
- **$` z_i = 0 `$**: Average value for this feature
- **$` z_i = 1 `$**: One standard deviation above average
- **$` z_i = -1 `$**: One standard deviation below average
- **$` |z_i| > 2 `$**: Unusual value (more than 2 standard deviations from mean)

### Step-by-step Example

Suppose we have a dataset with two features:

| Example | Height (cm) | Age (years) |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| 1       | 170         | 30          |
| 2       | 160         | 25          |
| 3       | 180         | 35          |

**Step 1: Compute the mean of each feature**
- Mean height: $` \mu_h = \frac{170 + 160 + 180}{3} = 170 `$
- Mean age: $` \mu_a = \frac{30 + 25 + 35}{3} = 30 `$

**The Centering Process:**
- **Original heights**: [170, 160, 180]
- **Mean height**: 170
- **Centered heights**: [0, -10, +10]
- **Interpretation**: First person is average height, second is 10cm below average, third is 10cm above average

**Step 2: Subtract the mean from each value (centering)**
- Centered heights: $` [0, -10, +10] `$
- Centered ages: $` [0, -5, +5] `$

**Step 3: Compute the standard deviation of each feature**
- Std height: $` \sigma_h = \sqrt{\frac{0^2 + (-10)^2 + 10^2}{3}} = \sqrt{\frac{200}{3}} \approx 8.16 `$
- Std age: $` \sigma_a = \sqrt{\frac{0^2 + (-5)^2 + 5^2}{3}} = \sqrt{\frac{50}{3}} \approx 4.08 `$

**The Scaling Process:**
- **Centered heights**: [0, -10, +10]
- **Height std**: 8.16
- **Normalized heights**: [0, -1.23, 1.23]
- **Interpretation**: Second person is 1.23 standard deviations below average height

**Step 4: Divide each centered value by the standard deviation (scaling)**
- Normalized heights: $` [0, -1.23, 1.23] `$
- Normalized ages: $` [0, -1.23, 1.23] `$

**The Final Result:**
- **Both features**: Now have mean 0 and variance 1
- **Equal importance**: Both features contribute equally to PCA
- **Ready for PCA**: Data is properly normalized

After normalization, both features have mean 0 and variance 1, and are on the same scale. This prepares the data for PCA.

## The Core Problem: Finding Principal Components

Now, having normalized our data, how do we compute the "major axis of variation" $` u `$—that is, the direction on which the data approximately lies?

### The Big Picture: What Are Principal Components?

**The Direction Finding Problem:**
- **Data**: Cloud of points in high-dimensional space
- **Goal**: Find the direction where data varies the most
- **Result**: Principal component - the most important direction

**The Variance Maximization Intuition:**
- **High variance direction**: Data is spread out along this direction
- **Low variance direction**: Data is compressed along this direction
- **PCA goal**: Find directions that maximize spread (variance)

**The Information Preservation Principle:**
- **Variance = Information**: More variance means more information
- **Maximize variance**: Preserve as much information as possible
- **Minimize loss**: Lose as little information as possible

### Problem Formulation

We want to find the unit vector $` u `$ so that when the data is projected onto the direction corresponding to $` u `$, the variance of the projected data is maximized.

**The Projection Intuition:**
- **Data point**: $` x^{(i)} `$ in high-dimensional space
- **Direction**: Unit vector $` u `$
- **Projection**: $` x^{(i)T} u `$ (scalar value)
- **Goal**: Choose $` u `$ to maximize variance of projections

**Intuition:** The data starts off with some amount of variance/information in it. We would like to choose a direction $` u `$ so that if we were to approximate the data as lying in the direction/subspace corresponding to $` u `$, as much as possible of this variance is still retained.

**The Information Retention Goal:**
- **Original data**: Has total variance $` \sum_{i=1}^d \text{Var}(X_i) `$
- **Projected data**: Has variance $` \text{Var}(u^T X) `$
- **Objective**: Maximize $` \text{Var}(u^T X) `$ to retain most information

### Visual Example

Consider the following dataset, on which we have already carried out the normalization steps:

<img src="./img/pca_projection_example.png" width="300px"/>

**The Data Cloud:**
- **Points**: Scattered in 2D space
- **Shape**: Elongated cloud (more variation in one direction)
- **Goal**: Find the direction of maximum elongation

**Good Direction:** Suppose we pick $` u `$ to correspond to the direction shown in the figure below. The circles denote the projections of the original data onto this line.

<img src="./img/pca_projection_line1.png" width="300px"/>

**The Good Direction Analysis:**
- **Direction**: Along the long axis of the data cloud
- **Projections**: Spread out along the line
- **Variance**: High variance in projections
- **Information**: Most information preserved

We see that the projected data still has a fairly large variance, and the points tend to be far from zero.

**Poor Direction:** In contrast, suppose we had instead picked the following direction:

<img src="./img/pca_projection_line2.png" width="300px"/>

**The Poor Direction Analysis:**
- **Direction**: Perpendicular to the long axis
- **Projections**: Compressed along the line
- **Variance**: Low variance in projections
- **Information**: Most information lost

Here, the projections have a significantly smaller variance, and are much closer to the origin.

### Mathematical Formulation

We want to automatically select the direction $` u `$ corresponding to the first case. To formalize this:

1. **Projection:** Given a unit vector $` u `$ and a point $` x `$, the length of the projection of $` x `$ onto $` u `$ is given by $` x^T u `$.

**The Projection Formula:**
- **Geometric interpretation**: Drop perpendicular from point to line
- **Mathematical formula**: $` \text{proj}_u(x) = x^T u `$ (assuming $` u `$ is unit vector)
- **Result**: Scalar value representing position along direction $` u `$

2. **Variance of Projections:** If $` x^{(i)} `$ is a point in our dataset, then its projection onto $` u `$ is distance $` x^{(i)T} u `$ from the origin.

**The Variance Calculation:**
- **Projections**: $` [x^{(1)T} u, x^{(2)T} u, \ldots, x^{(n)T} u] `$
- **Mean**: $` \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n x^{(i)T} u = 0 `$ (because data is centered)
- **Variance**: $` \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (x^{(i)T} u)^2 `$

3. **Objective Function:** To maximize the variance of the projections, we want to choose a unit-length $` u `$ so as to maximize:

```math
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (x^{(i)T} u)^2 = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n u^T x^{(i)} x^{(i)T} u = u^T \left( \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n x^{(i)} x^{(i)T} \right) u
```

**The Objective Function Explained:**
- **Goal**: Maximize variance of projections
- **Formula**: $` \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (x^{(i)T} u)^2 `$
- **Rearrangement**: $` u^T \left( \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n x^{(i)} x^{(i)T} \right) u `$
- **Interpretation**: Quadratic form in $` u `$

4. **Covariance Matrix:** We recognize that $` \Sigma = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n x^{(i)} x^{(i)T} `$ is the empirical covariance matrix of the data (assuming it has zero mean).

**The Covariance Matrix:**
- **Definition**: $` \Sigma = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n x^{(i)} x^{(i)T} `$
- **Properties**: Symmetric, positive semi-definite
- **Interpretation**: Describes how features vary together
- **Diagonal elements**: Variances of individual features
- **Off-diagonal elements**: Covariances between feature pairs

5. **Optimization Problem:** We want to maximize $` u^T \Sigma u `$ subject to $` \|u\|_2 = 1 `$.

**The Constrained Optimization:**
- **Objective**: Maximize $` u^T \Sigma u `$
- **Constraint**: $` \|u\|_2 = 1 `$ (unit vector)
- **Interpretation**: Find direction that maximizes variance while staying on unit sphere

### Solution via Eigenvalue Decomposition

The maximizing $` u `$ subject to $` \|u\|_2 = 1 `$ gives the principal eigenvector of $` \Sigma `$.

**The Eigenvalue Connection:**
- **Problem**: Maximize $` u^T \Sigma u `$ subject to $` \|u\|_2 = 1 `$
- **Solution**: Eigenvector corresponding to largest eigenvalue
- **Value**: Maximum value equals the largest eigenvalue

**Derivation using Lagrange Multipliers:**

We want to maximize $` f(u) = u^T \Sigma u `$ subject to the constraint $` g(u) = u^T u - 1 = 0 `$.

The Lagrangian is:
```math
L(u, \lambda) = u^T \Sigma u - \lambda(u^T u - 1)
```

Taking the gradient with respect to $` u `$ and setting it to zero:
```math
\nabla_u L = 2\Sigma u - 2\lambda u = 0
```

This gives us:
```math
\Sigma u = \lambda u
```

This is the eigenvalue equation! The solution $` u `$ is an eigenvector of $` \Sigma `$ with eigenvalue $` \lambda `$.

**The Lagrange Multiplier Intuition:**
- **Objective**: Maximize variance $` u^T \Sigma u `$
- **Constraint**: Stay on unit sphere $` \|u\|_2 = 1 `$
- **Lagrange multiplier**: Balances objective and constraint
- **Result**: Eigenvalue equation emerges naturally

**Key Insight:** The eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue gives us the direction of maximum variance.

**The Eigenvalue Interpretation:**
- **Eigenvalue**: Amount of variance captured by this direction
- **Largest eigenvalue**: Maximum possible variance
- **Eigenvector**: Direction that achieves this maximum
