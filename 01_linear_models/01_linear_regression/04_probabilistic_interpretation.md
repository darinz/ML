# 1.3 Probabilistic interpretation

When faced with a regression problem, why might linear regression, and specifically why might the least-squares cost function $J$, be a reasonable choice? In this section, we will give a set of probabilistic assumptions, under which least-squares regression is derived as a very natural algorithm.

## From Optimization Methods to Probabilistic Justification

So far, we've learned how to solve linear regression problems using gradient descent and normal equations. These methods give us practical ways to find the optimal parameters $\theta$ that minimize our cost function. But we haven't addressed a fundamental question: **Why should we use the least squares cost function in the first place?**

The answer requires us to think probabilistically about how our data is generated. By making specific assumptions about the underlying data-generating process, we can show that the least squares approach isn't just a convenient heuristic—it's the **optimal solution** under those assumptions.

This probabilistic interpretation connects our optimization methods to fundamental principles in statistics and provides a theoretical foundation that justifies our choice of cost function. It also opens the door to more sophisticated approaches like Bayesian regression and generalized linear models.

### The Big Picture: Why This Matters

Think of it this way: **Optimization methods tell us HOW to solve the problem, but probabilistic interpretation tells us WHY the problem is worth solving in the first place.**

- **Optimization perspective**: "Find parameters that minimize the sum of squared errors"
- **Probabilistic perspective**: "Find parameters that make our observed data most likely under a reasonable model of how the world works"

The probabilistic approach gives us:
1. **Confidence**: We know our method is optimal under certain conditions
2. **Interpretability**: We understand what assumptions we're making
3. **Extensions**: We can modify the assumptions to handle different scenarios
4. **Uncertainty**: We can quantify how uncertain our predictions are

## Why Probabilistic Interpretation?

Before diving into the mathematics, let's understand why a probabilistic interpretation is valuable:

**Benefits of probabilistic thinking:**
1. **Theoretical foundation**: Provides a principled justification for least squares
2. **Uncertainty quantification**: Allows us to understand prediction uncertainty
3. **Model comparison**: Enables comparison of different models using likelihood
4. **Extensions**: Foundation for more sophisticated methods (Bayesian regression, GLMs)
5. **Interpretability**: Helps understand what assumptions we're making

**Key insight**: Least squares isn't just a heuristic - it's the optimal solution under certain probabilistic assumptions.

### Intuitive Example: House Price Prediction

Imagine you're trying to predict house prices. You have data on square footage, number of bedrooms, and location. 

- **Optimization approach**: "Find the best line that minimizes prediction errors"
- **Probabilistic approach**: "Assume house prices are determined by a linear function of features plus some random noise, then find the parameters that make our observed prices most likely"

The probabilistic approach tells us:
- **What we're modeling**: The systematic relationship (linear) + random variation
- **What we're assuming**: The noise follows a specific distribution (Gaussian)
- **Why it's reasonable**: Many small, independent factors affect house prices
- **What we can do**: Quantify uncertainty, compare models, extend to new scenarios

## Linear Model Assumption

Let us assume that the target variables and the inputs are related via the equation

$$
y^{(i)} = \theta^T x^{(i)} + \epsilon^{(i)},
$$

where $y^{(i)}$ is the observed output for the $i$-th data point, $x^{(i)}$ is the corresponding input feature vector, $\theta$ is the parameter vector we wish to learn, and $\epsilon^{(i)}$ is an error term. This model asserts that the relationship between the inputs and outputs is linear, up to some noise or unmodeled effects.

### Understanding the Linear Model

**Components of the model:**
- **Systematic part**: $\theta^T x^{(i)}$ - the predictable relationship
- **Random part**: $\epsilon^{(i)}$ - the unpredictable noise

**What this assumption means:**
1. **Linearity**: The expected value of $y$ is a linear function of $x$
2. **Additive noise**: The noise is added to the systematic part, not multiplied
3. **Deterministic parameters**: $\theta$ is fixed (not random) but unknown

**Example**: For house prices:
- $\theta^T x^{(i)}$ might be: $50 + 0.1 \times \text{area} + 20 \times \text{bedrooms}$
- $\epsilon^{(i)}$ captures: location effects, market timing, unique features, measurement error

### Visualizing the Linear Model

**For a single feature (e.g., house area):**
```
Price = θ₀ + θ₁ × Area + ε
```

At any given area, the price follows a distribution around the line:
- **Expected price**: θ₀ + θ₁ × Area (the systematic part)
- **Actual price**: Varies around this expectation due to noise ε

**For multiple features:**
```
Price = θ₀ + θ₁ × Area + θ₂ × Bedrooms + θ₃ × Location + ε
```

The model predicts a hyperplane in feature space, with noise around it.

### Why Linear Models?

**Advantages:**
1. **Interpretability**: Each coefficient has a clear meaning
2. **Computational efficiency**: Easy to fit and make predictions
3. **Statistical properties**: Well-understood theoretical properties
4. **Baseline**: Good starting point for more complex models

**When they work well:**
- True relationship is approximately linear
- Noise is additive and relatively small
- Features are not highly correlated
- No strong non-linear interactions

**Limitations:**
- Can't capture non-linear relationships
- Assumes additive noise (not multiplicative)
- May miss important interactions between features

## Gaussian Noise Model

The error term $\epsilon^{(i)}$ captures either unmodeled effects (such as if there are some features very pertinent to predicting housing price, but that we'd left out of the regression), or random noise. To proceed probabilistically, we further assume that the $\epsilon^{(i)}$ are distributed IID (independently and identically distributed) according to a Gaussian (Normal) distribution with mean zero and some variance $\sigma^2$:

$$
\epsilon^{(i)} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)
$$

### Why Gaussian Noise?

This is a common assumption in statistics and machine learning, as the Gaussian distribution arises naturally in many contexts (e.g., by the Central Limit Theorem). It also leads to mathematically convenient properties.

**Theoretical justifications:**
1. **Central Limit Theorem**: Sum of many small, independent effects tends to be Gaussian
2. **Maximum entropy**: Gaussian has maximum entropy among distributions with given mean/variance
3. **Mathematical convenience**: Gaussian distributions have nice properties for optimization

**Practical considerations:**
- **Robustness**: Results are often robust to moderate violations of Gaussianity
- **Outliers**: Gaussian assumption can be sensitive to outliers
- **Heteroscedasticity**: Assumes constant variance across all $x$ values

### Intuitive Understanding of Gaussian Noise

**The Central Limit Theorem in action:**
Imagine all the factors that affect house prices:
- Location desirability
- Market conditions
- Property condition
- Seller motivation
- Buyer preferences
- Economic factors
- Seasonal effects
- ... and many more

Each factor contributes a small amount to the final price. When you add up many small, independent effects, the result tends to follow a Gaussian distribution, regardless of the individual distributions.

**Real-world analogy:**
Think of measuring the height of people. Many factors influence height:
- Genetics
- Nutrition during childhood
- Environmental factors
- Random genetic variations
- Measurement error

The combination of all these factors results in a roughly Gaussian distribution of heights.

### Properties of Gaussian Noise

The density of $\epsilon^{(i)}$ is given by:

$$
p(\epsilon^{(i)}) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} \exp\left(-\frac{(\epsilon^{(i)})^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)
$$

**Key properties:**
1. **Symmetry**: Positive and negative errors are equally likely
2. **Bell-shaped**: Most errors are small, large errors are rare
3. **68-95-99.7 rule**: 68% of errors within $\pm\sigma$, 95% within $\pm2\sigma$, 99.7% within $\pm3\sigma$

This means that most of the time, the error is close to zero, but larger deviations are possible with exponentially decreasing probability.

### Visualizing Gaussian Noise

**The bell curve:**
- **Peak**: Most errors are close to zero
- **Tails**: Large errors become increasingly rare
- **Symmetry**: Positive and negative errors are equally likely

**In the context of house prices:**
- **Small errors** (within ±$10,000): Very common
- **Medium errors** (within ±$50,000): Less common
- **Large errors** (within ±$100,000): Rare
- **Very large errors** (beyond ±$200,000): Very rare

### Independence and Identical Distribution

**Independence**: $\epsilon^{(i)}$ and $\epsilon^{(j)}$ are independent for $i \neq j$
- **Meaning**: Errors for different data points don't influence each other
- **Violation**: Time series data, spatial data, repeated measurements

**Identical distribution**: All $\epsilon^{(i)}$ have the same distribution $\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$
- **Meaning**: The noise characteristics don't change across data points
- **Violation**: Heteroscedasticity (variance changes with $x$)

### When Independence Fails

**Time series example:**
House prices in a neighborhood might be correlated over time due to market trends. If one house sells for more than expected, nearby houses might also sell for more.

**Spatial example:**
Houses in the same neighborhood might have correlated errors due to shared location factors (school quality, crime rates, etc.).

**Repeated measurements:**
If you measure the same house multiple times, the measurement errors might be correlated.

### When Identical Distribution Fails

**Heteroscedasticity example:**
Luxury homes might have more variable prices than starter homes. The variance of the noise might depend on the house price itself.

**Non-constant variance:**
- **Luxury homes**: High variance (prices vary widely)
- **Starter homes**: Lower variance (prices more predictable)

## Conditional Distribution of $y^{(i)}$

Given the linear model and the Gaussian noise, the conditional distribution of $y^{(i)}$ given $x^{(i)}$ and $\theta$ is also Gaussian:

$$
p(y^{(i)}|x^{(i)}; \theta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} \exp\left(-\frac{(y^{(i)} - \theta^T x^{(i)})^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)
$$

### Understanding the Conditional Distribution

This says that, for a given input $x^{(i)}$, the output $y^{(i)}$ is most likely to be near $\theta^T x^{(i)}$, but can deviate from it due to noise.

**Key insights:**
1. **Mean**: $E[y^{(i)}|x^{(i)}] = \theta^T x^{(i)}$ - the systematic part
2. **Variance**: $\text{Var}[y^{(i)}|x^{(i)}] = \sigma^2$ - constant across all $x$
3. **Shape**: Gaussian distribution around the mean

**Example**: For a house with 2000 sq ft and 3 bedrooms:
- Expected price: $\theta_0 + \theta_1 \times 2000 + \theta_2 \times 3$
- Actual price: Gaussian around this expected value with variance $\sigma^2$

The notation $p(y^{(i)}|x^{(i)}; \theta)$ indicates that this is the probability density of $y^{(i)}$ given $x^{(i)}$ and parameterized by $\theta$. Note that $\theta$ is not a random variable here; it is a parameter to be estimated.

### Visualizing the Model

**For a single feature $x$:**
- The model predicts a line: $y = \theta_0 + \theta_1 x$
- At each $x$ value, $y$ follows a Gaussian distribution
- The variance $\sigma^2$ determines how spread out the $y$ values are

**For multiple features:**
- The model predicts a hyperplane: $y = \theta^T x$
- The same Gaussian noise applies at each point in feature space

### Intuitive Example: Temperature vs. Ice Cream Sales

**The model:**
```
Sales = θ₀ + θ₁ × Temperature + ε
```

**At 25°C:**
- Expected sales: θ₀ + θ₁ × 25
- Actual sales: Gaussian around this expectation
- Most likely: Close to the expected value
- Less likely: Far from the expected value

**At 35°C:**
- Expected sales: θ₀ + θ₁ × 35 (higher)
- Same variance σ²
- Same Gaussian shape, just shifted

### The Power of Conditional Thinking

**Why conditional distributions matter:**
1. **Prediction**: We can predict the most likely value
2. **Uncertainty**: We can quantify how uncertain our predictions are
3. **Comparison**: We can compare different models
4. **Optimization**: We can find the best parameters

**The key insight:**
Instead of thinking "what is the probability of this data point?", we think "what is the probability of this data point given our model and parameters?"

## Likelihood Function

Given $X$ (the design matrix, which contains all the $x^{(i)}$'s) and $\theta$, what is the probability of observing the data $\vec{y}$? The likelihood function is defined as:

$$
L(\theta; X, \vec{y}) = p(\vec{y}|X; \theta)
$$

### Understanding Likelihood

The likelihood function measures how probable our observed data is, given a particular choice of parameters $\theta$.

**Key points:**
1. **Data is fixed**: We observe $\vec{y}$ and $X$, these don't change
2. **Parameters vary**: We consider different values of $\theta$
3. **Not a probability**: Likelihood is not a probability distribution over $\theta$

**Intuition**: "How likely is it that we would observe this data if the true parameters were $\theta$?"

### Likelihood vs. Probability

**Important distinction:**
- **Probability**: $p(\text{data}|\text{model})$ - how likely is the data given the model?
- **Likelihood**: $L(\text{model}|\text{data})$ - how well does the model explain the data?

**Example:**
- **Probability**: "What's the chance of getting 3 heads in 5 coin flips if the coin is fair?"
- **Likelihood**: "How likely is it that the coin is fair given that we got 3 heads in 5 flips?"

### Intuitive Example: Coin Flipping

**Scenario**: You flip a coin 10 times and get 7 heads.

**Question**: What's the likelihood that the coin is fair (p = 0.5)?

**Calculation**: 
- Probability of 7 heads with fair coin: $\binom{10}{7} \times 0.5^7 \times 0.5^3 = 0.117$
- This is the likelihood of the fair coin model given our data

**Question**: What's the likelihood that the coin has p = 0.7?

**Calculation**:
- Probability of 7 heads with p = 0.7: $\binom{10}{7} \times 0.7^7 \times 0.3^3 = 0.267$
- This is higher! The p = 0.7 model better explains our data.

### Factorization Under Independence

Assuming the data points are independent given $\theta$, the likelihood factorizes as a product:

$$
L(\theta) = \prod_{i=1}^n p(y^{(i)} \mid x^{(i)}; \theta)
= \prod_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} \exp\left(-\frac{(y^{(i)} - \theta^T x^{(i)})^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)
$$

**Why this factorization works:**
- Independence means: $p(\vec{y}|X; \theta) = \prod_{i=1}^n p(y^{(i)}|x^{(i)}; \theta)$
- Each term is the probability of observing $y^{(i)}$ given $x^{(i)}$ and $\theta$

This function measures how probable the observed data is, as a function of $\theta$.

### Intuitive Understanding of Factorization

**Why multiply probabilities?**
- **Independent events**: Probability of A AND B = P(A) × P(B)
- **Our data**: Each data point is independent given the model
- **Overall likelihood**: Probability of observing ALL our data points

**Example with 3 houses:**
- House 1: Probability of observing its price given the model
- House 2: Probability of observing its price given the model  
- House 3: Probability of observing its price given the model
- **Total likelihood**: Product of all three probabilities

### Likelihood as a Function of $\theta$

**For different $\theta$ values:**
- **Good $\theta$**: High likelihood (data is probable)
- **Bad $\theta$**: Low likelihood (data is improbable)
- **Best $\theta$**: Maximum likelihood

**Example**: If $\theta$ predicts house prices close to observed prices, likelihood is high.

### Visualizing Likelihood

**For a simple case (one parameter θ₁):**
```
Likelihood
    ^
    |    /\
    |   /  \
    |  /    \
    | /      \
    |/        \
    +-------------> θ₁
```

**Key features:**
- **Peak**: Maximum likelihood estimate
- **Width**: How certain we are about the parameter
- **Shape**: How the likelihood changes with different parameter values

## Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)

The principle of **maximum likelihood** says that we should choose $\theta$ to maximize the likelihood $L(\theta)$, i.e., to make the observed data as probable as possible under our model. This is a general principle in statistics and machine learning for parameter estimation.

### Why Maximum Likelihood?

**Theoretical justification:**
1. **Consistency**: MLE converges to true parameters as $n \to \infty$
2. **Efficiency**: MLE has smallest variance among unbiased estimators (asymptotically)
3. **Invariance**: If $\hat{\theta}$ is MLE, then $f(\hat{\theta})$ is MLE of $f(\theta)$

**Intuitive justification:**
- "Choose parameters that make our observations most likely"
- "If our model is correct, the true parameters should make our data probable"

### Intuitive Example: Guessing a Coin's Bias

**Scenario**: You have a biased coin, but you don't know the bias. You flip it 100 times and get 70 heads.

**Question**: What's your best guess for the coin's bias?

**MLE approach**: 
- Try different values of p (bias)
- Calculate likelihood for each p
- Choose the p that makes 70 heads most likely

**Result**: p = 0.7 maximizes the likelihood
- This makes sense: 70/100 = 0.7

### Connection to Other Methods

**MLE vs. Least Squares:**
- **MLE**: Maximize probability of observing data
- **Least Squares**: Minimize sum of squared errors
- **Under Gaussian noise**: These are equivalent!

**MLE vs. MAP (Maximum A Posteriori):**
- **MLE**: $\hat{\theta} = \arg\max_\theta L(\theta)$
- **MAP**: $\hat{\theta} = \arg\max_\theta L(\theta) p(\theta)$ (includes prior)

### The Beauty of MLE

**Why MLE is powerful:**
1. **Universal**: Works for any probabilistic model
2. **Intuitive**: "Choose what makes the data most likely"
3. **Theoretical**: Has strong theoretical guarantees
4. **Practical**: Often leads to tractable optimization problems

**The key insight:**
Instead of guessing parameters and checking if they work, we let the data tell us what the most likely parameters are.

## Log-Likelihood and Connection to Least Squares

Maximizing the likelihood is equivalent to maximizing any strictly increasing function of it, such as the log-likelihood. Taking the logarithm simplifies the product into a sum, which is easier to work with:

$$
\begin{align*}
\ell(\theta) &= \log L(\theta) \\
&= \log \prod_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} \exp\left(-\frac{(y^{(i)} - \theta^T x^{(i)})^2}{2\sigma^2}\right) \\
&= \sum_{i=1}^n \log \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} \exp\left(-\frac{(y^{(i)} - \theta^T x^{(i)})^2}{2\sigma^2}\right) \\
&= n \log \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} - \frac{1}{2\sigma^2} \sum_{i=1}^n (y^{(i)} - \theta^T x^{(i)})^2
\end{align*}
$$

### Why Take the Logarithm?

**Mathematical reasons:**
1. **Product to sum**: $\log(ab) = \log(a) + \log(b)$
2. **Numerical stability**: Products of small numbers can underflow
3. **Optimization**: Sums are easier to differentiate than products

**Intuitive reasons:**
- **Logarithms preserve order**: If $a > b$, then $\log(a) > \log(b)$
- **Easier to work with**: Sums are simpler than products
- **Better numerical properties**: Avoids very small or large numbers

### Step-by-Step Derivation

**Step 1: Take logarithm of product**
$\log \prod_{i=1}^n f_i = \sum_{i=1}^n \log f_i$

**Step 2: Expand each term**
$\log \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} \exp\left(-\frac{(y^{(i)} - \theta^T x^{(i)})^2}{2\sigma^2}\right) = \log \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} - \frac{(y^{(i)} - \theta^T x^{(i)})^2}{2\sigma^2}$

**Step 3: Sum over all terms**
The first term becomes $n \log \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}$ (constant)
The second term becomes $-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2} \sum_{i=1}^n (y^{(i)} - \theta^T x^{(i)})^2$

### The Key Insight

Notice that the first term does not depend on $\theta$, so maximizing $\ell(\theta)$ is equivalent to minimizing the sum of squared errors:

$$
\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^n (y^{(i)} - \theta^T x^{(i)})^2
$$

This is exactly the least-squares cost function $J(\theta)$ used in linear regression. Thus, under the Gaussian noise assumption, least-squares regression is equivalent to maximum likelihood estimation.

**Why this matters:**
1. **Justification**: Least squares is optimal under Gaussian noise
2. **Unification**: Connects geometric and probabilistic interpretations
3. **Extensions**: Foundation for more sophisticated methods

### The Beautiful Connection

**What we've discovered:**
- **Geometric approach**: Minimize Euclidean distance
- **Probabilistic approach**: Maximize likelihood
- **Under Gaussian noise**: These are the same thing!

**The intuition:**
- **Least squares**: "Find the line closest to all points"
- **MLE**: "Find the line that makes the data most likely"
- **Gaussian noise**: These are equivalent because Gaussian distributions are symmetric and centered on the mean

### Visualizing the Connection

**For a single data point:**
- **Least squares**: Minimize $(y - \hat{y})^2$
- **MLE**: Maximize $\exp(-\frac{(y - \hat{y})^2}{2\sigma^2})$
- **Connection**: Both are minimized/maximized when $y = \hat{y}$

**For multiple data points:**
- **Least squares**: Minimize sum of squared errors
- **MLE**: Maximize product of probabilities
- **Log-likelihood**: Maximize sum of log-probabilities
- **Connection**: The squared error term appears in both

## Summary and Broader Perspective

To summarize: Under the previous probabilistic assumptions on the data, least-squares regression corresponds to finding the maximum likelihood estimate of $\theta$. This is thus one set of assumptions under which least-squares regression can be justified as a very natural method that's just doing maximum likelihood estimation. 

### Key Takeaways

1. **Gaussian noise + linear model → least squares is optimal**
2. **MLE provides principled justification for least squares**
3. **Log-likelihood connects probability to optimization**
4. **Assumptions matter - check if they hold in practice**

### Alternative Justifications

However, the probabilistic assumptions are by no means **necessary** for least-squares to be a perfectly good and rational procedure, and there may—and indeed there are—other natural assumptions that can also be used to justify it. For example, least-squares can also be motivated from a geometric perspective (minimizing the Euclidean distance between predictions and observations), or as a method of moments estimator.

**Geometric interpretation:**
- Minimize Euclidean distance between predictions and observations
- Project $\vec{y}$ onto the column space of $X$

**Method of moments:**
- Match sample moments to population moments
- First moment: $E[y] = \theta^T E[x]$

> **Practical note:** In real-world data, the Gaussian noise assumption may not always hold. Outliers, heteroscedasticity (non-constant variance), or non-linear relationships can violate the assumptions. In such cases, alternative models or robust regression techniques may be more appropriate.

### When Assumptions Are Violated

**Non-Gaussian noise:**
- **Heavy tails**: Use robust regression (Huber loss, LAD)
- **Skewed**: Consider log transformation or quantile regression
- **Discrete**: Use Poisson regression, logistic regression

**Non-constant variance (heteroscedasticity):**
- **Weighted least squares**: Weight by inverse variance
- **Generalized least squares**: Model the variance structure
- **Transformations**: Log, square root transformations

**Non-linear relationships:**
- **Polynomial regression**: Add polynomial terms
- **Spline regression**: Use piecewise polynomials
- **Kernel methods**: Non-linear feature transformations

### Practical Guidelines

**When to use least squares:**
1. **Linear relationship**: Data shows roughly linear pattern
2. **Constant variance**: Spread of residuals is roughly constant
3. **Gaussian noise**: Residuals follow roughly normal distribution
4. **Independent errors**: No obvious correlation in residuals

**When to consider alternatives:**
1. **Outliers**: Use robust regression methods
2. **Non-constant variance**: Use weighted least squares
3. **Non-linear patterns**: Use polynomial or spline regression
4. **Categorical outcomes**: Use logistic regression

## Independence from $\sigma^2$

Note also that, in our previous discussion, our final choice of $\theta$ did not depend on what was $\sigma^2$, and indeed we'd have arrived at the same result even if $\sigma^2$ were unknown. This is because $\sigma^2$ only affects the scaling of the likelihood, not the location of its maximum with respect to $\theta$. We will use this fact again later, when we talk about the exponential family and generalized linear models.

### Understanding This Result

**Why $\sigma^2$ doesn't affect $\hat{\theta}$:**
1. **Scaling factor**: $\sigma^2$ only scales the likelihood function
2. **Location invariance**: Scaling doesn't change where the maximum occurs
3. **Practical implication**: We can estimate $\theta$ without knowing $\sigma^2$

**Estimating $\sigma^2$:**
If we want to estimate $\sigma^2$ as well, we can use:
$$\hat{\sigma}^2 = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (y^{(i)} - \hat{\theta}^T x^{(i)})^2$$

**Connection to degrees of freedom:**
For unbiased estimation, we often use:
$$\hat{\sigma}^2 = \frac{1}{n-d-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (y^{(i)} - \hat{\theta}^T x^{(i)})^2$$
where $d+1$ is the number of parameters (accounting for degrees of freedom).

### Intuitive Understanding

**The key insight:**
The noise variance $\sigma^2$ tells us how much uncertainty there is, but it doesn't tell us where the best line should be.

**Analogy:**
Imagine you're trying to find the center of a target. The size of the target (variance) doesn't change where the center is, it just tells you how precise your shots need to be.

**Practical implications:**
- We can fit the model without knowing the noise level
- We can estimate the noise level from the residuals
- The parameter estimates are robust to misspecification of the variance

### Broader Implications

This independence property is important because:
1. **Robustness**: Our parameter estimates are robust to misspecification of $\sigma^2$
2. **Simplicity**: We can focus on estimating $\theta$ first, then $\sigma^2$ if needed
3. **Generalization**: This property extends to other exponential family distributions

**In practice:**
- We often don't know the true noise variance
- We can still get good parameter estimates
- We can estimate the variance from the residuals if needed

### Estimating the Noise Variance

**Why estimate $\sigma^2$?**
1. **Prediction intervals**: To quantify uncertainty in predictions
2. **Model comparison**: To compare models with different complexity
3. **Diagnostics**: To check if the model assumptions hold

**Methods:**
1. **Maximum likelihood**: $\hat{\sigma}^2 = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (y^{(i)} - \hat{\theta}^T x^{(i)})^2$
2. **Unbiased estimator**: $\hat{\sigma}^2 = \frac{1}{n-d-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (y^{(i)} - \hat{\theta}^T x^{(i)})^2$

**Degrees of freedom correction:**
- We lose $d+1$ degrees of freedom by estimating $\theta$
- The correction accounts for this in the variance estimate

## From Global to Local Models

We've now built a complete theoretical foundation for linear regression, understanding both how to solve the optimization problem (gradient descent and normal equations) and why the least squares approach makes sense (probabilistic interpretation). Our models assume a **global linear relationship** between features and target, which works well when the data truly follows a linear pattern.

However, real-world data is often more complex. The relationship between features and target might be **locally linear** but **globally non-linear**. For example, house prices might follow different patterns in different neighborhoods, or the effect of temperature on energy consumption might vary by season.

This motivates our final topic: **locally weighted linear regression (LWR)**, which adapts the linear model to capture local structure in the data. Instead of fitting one global model, LWR fits a separate linear model for each prediction point, giving more weight to nearby training examples.

This approach bridges the gap between simple parametric models and complex non-linear methods, showing how we can extend linear regression to handle more sophisticated data patterns while maintaining interpretability.

### The Limitations of Global Linear Models

**When global linearity fails:**
1. **Non-linear relationships**: Temperature vs. energy consumption
2. **Interaction effects**: The effect of one feature depends on another
3. **Heterogeneous data**: Different patterns in different regions
4. **Complex systems**: Many real-world phenomena are inherently non-linear

**Examples:**
- **House prices**: Different markets have different price dynamics
- **Temperature effects**: Energy consumption might be linear in moderate temperatures but non-linear in extremes
- **Economic data**: Relationships change over time and across regions

### The Power of Local Models

**Local linearity assumption:**
- **Globally**: The relationship might be complex
- **Locally**: The relationship is approximately linear
- **Strategy**: Fit linear models to small neighborhoods

**Advantages:**
1. **Flexibility**: Can capture complex, non-linear patterns
2. **Interpretability**: Each local model is still linear
3. **Robustness**: Less sensitive to outliers in distant regions
4. **Adaptability**: Automatically adapts to local structure

**Trade-offs:**
1. **Computational cost**: Need to fit many local models
2. **Parameter tuning**: Need to choose neighborhood size
3. **Overfitting**: Risk of fitting noise in small neighborhoods
