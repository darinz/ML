    "# 1.2 The normal equations\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient descent gives one way of minimizing $J$. However, gradient descent requires iterative updates and careful tuning of the learning rate. In contrast, the normal equations approach allows us to directly solve for the optimal parameters in one step, provided the problem is well-posed and the necessary matrix inverses exist. This is especially useful for linear regression problems where the cost function is quadratic and differentiable. In this method, we will minimize $J$ by explicitly taking its derivatives with respect to the $\\theta_j$'s, and setting them to zero. To enable us to do this without having to write reams of algebra and pages full of matrices of derivatives, let's introduce some notation for doing calculus with matrices.\n",

    "## Why Normal Equations?\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into the mathematics, let's understand why we might prefer normal equations over gradient descent:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages of Normal Equations:**\n",
    "1. **Exact solution**: No need for iterative optimization\n",
    "2. **No hyperparameters**: No learning rate to tune\n",
    "3. **Guaranteed convergence**: Always finds the global minimum (if it exists)\n",
    "4. **Theoretical insight**: Provides understanding of the optimal solution structure\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages of Normal Equations:**\n",
    "1. **Computational cost**: $O(n^3)$ for matrix inversion vs $O(n^2)$ per iteration for gradient descent\n",
    "2. **Memory usage**: Requires storing $X^T X$ matrix\n",
    "3. **Numerical instability**: Matrix inversion can be numerically unstable\n",
    "4. **Non-invertible matrices**: Fails when $X^T X$ is singular\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use each method:**\n",
    "- **Normal equations**: Small to medium datasets (< 10,000 examples), when you need exact solution\n",
    "- **Gradient descent**: Large datasets, when approximate solution is acceptable, or when $X^T X$ is singular\n",

    "## 1.2.1 Matrix derivatives\n",

    "When working with functions that take matrices as inputs, we generalize the concept of derivatives to matrices. For a function $f : \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d} \\mapsto \\mathbb{R}$ mapping from $n$-by-$d$ matrices to the real numbers, we define the derivative of $f$ with respect to $A$ to be:\n",

    "The gradient of a scalar-valued function with respect to a matrix is itself a matrix, where each entry is the partial derivative of the function with respect to the corresponding entry in the input matrix. This allows us to perform calculus operations in a compact, vectorized form, which is essential for efficient computation in machine learning.\n",

    "**Key properties:**\n",

    "\n",
    "Armed with the tools of matrix derivatives, let us now proceed to find in closed-form the value of $\\theta$ that minimizes $J(\\theta)$. We begin by re-writing $J$ in matrix-vectorial notation. The design matrix $X$ is a convenient way to represent all the input features of your training data in a single matrix. Each row corresponds to one training example, and each column corresponds to a feature (including the intercept term if present). This matrix formulation allows us to express the entire dataset and the linear model compactly, making it easier to apply linear algebra techniques.\n",
