    "**Implementation Advice and Notes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Wherever possible, use matrix libraries for matrix operations (not for\n",

    "- There are opportunities to considerably speed up parts of the\n",

    "  time).\n",
    "- As a sanity check, ensure the objective value is nonincreasing with\n",
    "  each step.\n",
    "- It is up to you to decide on a suitable stopping condition. A common\n",
    "  criteria is to stop when no element of $w$ changes by more than some\n",
    "  small $\\delta$ during an iteration. If you need your algorithm to run\n",
    "  faster, an easy place to start is to loosen this condition.\n",
    "- You will need to solve the Lasso on the same dataset for many values\n",
    "  of $\\lambda$. This is called a regularization path. One way to do this\n",
    "  efficiently is to start at a large $\\lambda$, and then for each\n",
    "  consecutive solution, initialize the algorithm with the previous\n",
    "  solution, decreasing $\\lambda$ by a constant ratio (e.g., by a factor\n",
    "  of 2).\n",
    "- The smallest value of $\\lambda$ for which the solution $\\hat{w}$ is\n",
    "  entirely zero is given by:\n",
    "  $$\\lambda_{max} = \\max_{k=1,...,d} \\left| 2 \\sum_{i=1}^n x_{i,k} \\left( y_i - \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{j=1}^n y_j \\right) \\right| \\quad (1)$$\n",
    "- This is helpful for choosing the first $\\lambda$ in a regularization\n",
    "  path.\n",

    "## Synthetic Data and Lasso Regularization Path\n",
    "\n",
    "**A6.** We will first try your solver with some synthetic data. A\n",
    "benefit of the Lasso is that if we believe many features are irrelevant\n",
    "for predicting $y$, the Lasso can be used to enforce a sparse solution,\n",

    "And $\\epsilon_i \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2)$ is noise (note that in the model\n",
    "above $b = 0$). We can see from Equation (2) that since $k < d$ and\n",
    "$w_j = 0$ for $j > k$, the features $k+1$ through $d$ are irrelevant for\n",
    "predicting $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generate a dataset using this model with $n = 500$, $d = 1000$,\n",
    "$k = 100$, and $\\sigma = 1$. You should generate the dataset such that\n",
    "each $\\epsilon_i \\sim N(0, 1)$, and $y_i$ is generated as specified\n",
    "above. You are free to choose a distribution from which the $x$’s are\n",

    "experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  With your synthetic data, solve multiple Lasso problems on a\n",
    "    regularization path, starting at $\\lambda_{max}$ where no features\n",
    "    are selected (see Equation (1)) and decreasing $\\lambda$ by a\n",
    "    constant ratio (e.g., 2) until nearly all the features are chosen.\n",
    "    In plot 1, plot the number of non-zeros as a function of $\\lambda$\n",
    "    on the x-axis (Tip: use `plt.xscale('log')`).\n",

    "    rate (FDR) (number of incorrect nonzeros in $\\hat{w}$/total number\n",
    "    of nonzeros in $\\hat{w}$) and true positive rate (TPR) (number of\n",

    "    an incorrect nonzero if and only if $\\hat{w}_j \\neq 0$ while\n",
    "    $w_j = 0$. In plot 2, plot these values with the x-axis as FDR, and\n",
    "    the y-axis as TPR. Note that in an ideal situation we would have an\n",
    "    (FDR,TPR) pair in the upper left corner. We can always trivially\n",
    "    achieve (0,0) and $(\\frac{d-k}{d}, 1)$.\n",

    "entries, respectively¹. We will use this training set to fit a model to\n",
    "predict the crime rate in new communities and evaluate model performance\n",
    "on the test set. As there are a considerable number of input variables\n",
