    "In class when we discussed the decision boundary for logistic regression $h_\\theta(x) = g(\\theta^T x)$, we did not require an explicit intercept term because we could define $x_0 = 1$ and let $\\theta_0$ be the intercept.

Consider an SVM where we now write $h_w(x) = g(w^T x)$ and define $x_0 = 1$ such that $w_0$ is the intercept. If the primal optimization objective remains $\\frac{1}{2}||w||^2$, can we change the intercept in this way without changing the decision boundary found by the SVM? Justify your answer.\n",
