    "\n",
    "**Problem:** The primal optimization problem for the one-class SVM was given above. Write down the corresponding dual optimization problem. Simplify your answer as much as possible. In particular, $w$ should not appear in your answer.\n",

    "**Answer:** The Lagrangian is given by\n",

    "\n",
    "**Problem:** Can the one-class SVM be kernelized (both in training and testing)? Justify your answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** Yes. For training we can use the dual formulation, in which only inner products of the data appear. For testing at a point $z$ we just need to evaluate $w^T z = (\\sum_{i=1}^m \\alpha_i x^{(i)})^T z = \\sum_{i=1}^m \\alpha_i x^{(i)^T} z$ in which the training data and the test point $z$ only appear in inner products.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Problem:** Give an SMO-like algorithm to optimize the dual. I.e., give an algorithm that in every optimization step optimizes over the smallest possible subset of variables. Also give in closed-form the update equation for this subset of variables. You should also justify why it is sufficient to consider this many variables at a time in each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** Since we have convex optimization problem with only independent coordinate wise constraints ($\\alpha_i \\ge 0$), we can optimize iteratively over 1 variable at a time. Optimizing w.r.t. $\\alpha_i$ is done by setting\n",
    "$$\\alpha_i = \\max \\left\\{ 0, \\frac{1}{K_{i,i}} \\left( 1 - \\sum_{j \\ne i} \\alpha_j K_{i,j} \\right) \\right\\}$$\n",

    "\n",
    "$^2$This turns out to be useful for anomaly detection. In anomaly detection you are given a set of data points that are all considered to be 'normal'. Given these 'normal' data points, the task is to decide for a new data point whether it is also 'normal' or not. Adding slack variables allows for training data that are not necessarily all 'normal'. The most common formulation with slack variables is not the most direct adaptation of the soft margin SVM formulation seen in class. Instead the $\\nu$-SVM formulation is often used. This formulation allows you to specify the fraction of outliers (instead of the constant $C$ which is harder to interpret). See the literature for details.\n",

As the number of training examples $m$ increases, would you expect the value of $\\tau$ selected by the algorithm to generally become larger, smaller, or neither of the above? For this problem, assume that (the expected value of) $y$ is a non-linear function of $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** Smaller. For any fixed $\\tau$, as the amount of training data increases, the prediction of locally weighted regression for a given $x$ will converge to the prediction of the line that best fits (the expected value of) $y$ in the $\\tau$-sized region around $x$. Since (the expected value of) $y$ is a non-linear function of $x$, the smaller $\\tau$, the better the performance for sufficiently large training data set.\n",

    "**Problem:** Consider a feature selection problem in which the mutual information $MI(x_i, y) = 0$ for all features $x_i$. Also for every subset of features $S_i = \\{x_{i_1}, \\dots, x_{i_k}\\}$ of size $< n/2$ we have $MI(S_i, y) = 0.^3$ However there is a subset $S^*$ of size exactly $n/2$ such that $MI(S^*, y) = 1$. I.e. this subset of features allows us to predict $y$ correctly. Of the three feature selection algorithms listed below, which one do you expect to work best on this dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "i. Forward Search.\n",
    "ii. Backward Search.\n",
    "iii. Filtering using mutual information $MI(x_i, y)$.\n",
    "iv. All three are expected to perform reasonably well.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** Backward Search, since it will be able to maintain a subset of features that predicts $y$ correctly down to only $n/2$ features. Forward Search has no way to distinguish between any subset of $< n/2$ features and will thus end up with arbitrary subsets of $< n/2$ features, which will be good subsets with very low probability; resulting in also having inferior subsets of features of size $\\ge n/2$. Filtering using mutual information cannot distinguish between any of the features, and will thus pick random subsets of the features.\n",
    "\n",
    "$^3 MI(S_i, y) = \\sum_{S_i} \\sum_y P(S_i, y) \\log(P(S_i, y)/P(S_i) P(y))$, where the first summation is over all possible values of the features in $S_i$.\n"
