    "\n",
    "**Answer:** We know from lecture that the least squares minimizer is\n",
    "$\\hat{\\theta} = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T \\bar{y}$ but because of the\n",
    "orthonormality assumption, this simplifies to\n",
    "$\\hat{\\theta} = X^T \\bar{y}$. Substituting this expression into the\n",

    "**Answer:** The result shows that we can either maintain or decrease the\n",
    "minimized square error objective by adding more features. However,\n",
    "remember that the error objective is computed only on the training\n",
    "samples and not the true data distribution. As a result, reducing\n",
    "training error does not guarantee a reduction in error on the true\n",
    "distribution. In fact, after a certain point adding features will likely\n",
