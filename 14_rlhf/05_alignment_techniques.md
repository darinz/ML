# Alignment Techniques

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of alignment techniques for reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) systems. We'll explore Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), Constitutional AI, Red Teaming, and other methods designed to make language models more useful, safe, and honest.

## From Policy Optimization to Advanced Alignment

We've now explored **policy optimization** - the core component of RLHF that updates the language model policy to maximize expected reward from human feedback. We've seen how policy gradient methods like REINFORCE and actor-critic approaches work for language models, how trust region methods like PPO and TRPO ensure stable policy updates, how to handle the unique challenges of language generation (sequential decisions, sparse rewards, high dimensionality), and how to balance reward maximization with maintaining language quality.

However, while policy optimization enables basic RLHF training, **the standard RLHF pipeline** has limitations in ensuring comprehensive alignment. Consider a model trained with RLHF - it may be helpful and harmless in most cases, but it might still have blind spots, be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, or lack explicit mechanisms for self-correction and safety.

This motivates our exploration of **advanced alignment techniques** - methods that go beyond standard RLHF to ensure more robust, safe, and beneficial AI behavior. We'll see how Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) eliminates the need for separate reward models, how Constitutional AI enables self-critique and revision, how Red Teaming systematically identifies and addresses safety vulnerabilities, and how multi-objective alignment balances competing objectives like helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty.

The transition from policy optimization to advanced alignment represents the bridge from basic RLHF to comprehensive AI safety - taking our understanding of how to optimize language model policies and applying it to the challenge of building AI systems that are not just capable but also safe, honest, and beneficial to society.

In this section, we'll explore advanced alignment techniques, understanding how to build more robust and safe AI systems that go beyond standard RLHF.

## Overview

Alignment techniques aim to ensure that language models behave in ways that are beneficial to humans and society. Unlike traditional machine learning that focuses on predictive accuracy, alignment focuses on learning and adhering to human values, preferences, and safety constraints.

### Key Concepts

**1. Value Alignment**: Ensuring models reflect human values and preferences
**2. Safety Alignment**: Preventing harmful or dangerous behaviors
**3. Honesty Alignment**: Promoting truthful and accurate responses
**4. Robustness**: Maintaining alignment under various conditions and attacks

### Alignment Challenges

**1. Value Pluralism**: Different humans have different values and preferences
**2. Specification Gaming**: Models optimizing for proxy objectives rather than true goals
**3. Distributional Shift**: Models behaving differently in deployment than training
**4. Adversarial Attacks**: Malicious attempts to make models behave badly

### Mathematical Framework

**General Alignment Objective**:
```math
\max_\theta \mathbb{E}_{x \sim \mathcal{D}} [V(\pi_\theta(x))]
\text{ subject to } C_i(\pi_\theta) \leq \delta_i \text{ for } i = 1, \ldots, k
```

Where:
- $`V(\pi_\theta(x))`$: Value function measuring alignment
- $`C_i(\pi_\theta)`$: Constraint functions (safety, honesty, etc.)
- $`\delta_i`$: Constraint thresholds

## Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)

### Mathematical Foundation

**DPO Objective**:
```math
\mathcal{L}_{\text{DPO}}(\theta) = -\mathbb{E}_{(x, y_w, y_l) \sim \mathcal{D}} \log \sigma\left(\beta \log \frac{\pi_\theta(y_w|x)}{\pi_{\text{ref}}(y_w|x)} - \beta \log \frac{\pi_\theta(y_l|x)}{\pi_{\text{ref}}(y_l|x)}\right)
```

Where:
- $`\pi_\theta`$: Current policy
- $`\pi_{\text{ref}}`$: Reference policy (usually pre-trained model)
- $`\beta`$: Temperature parameter controlling optimization strength
- $`\sigma`$: Sigmoid function

### Derivation

**From Reward Learning to Policy Optimization**:
```math
\begin{align}
R_\phi(x, y) &= \beta \log \frac{\pi_\theta(y|x)}{\pi_{\text{ref}}(y|x)} \\
P(y_w \succ y_l | x) &= \sigma(R_\phi(x, y_w) - R_\phi(x, y_l)) \\
&= \sigma\left(\beta \log \frac{\pi_\theta(y_w|x)}{\pi_{\text{ref}}(y_w|x)} - \beta \log \frac{\pi_\theta(y_l|x)}{\pi_{\text{ref}}(y_l|x)}\right)
\end{align}
```

**Key Insight**: DPO eliminates the need for a separate reward model by directly optimizing the policy to match human preferences.

## From Theoretical Understanding to Practical Implementation

We've now explored **advanced alignment techniques** - methods that go beyond standard RLHF to ensure more robust, safe, and beneficial AI behavior. We've seen how Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) eliminates the need for separate reward models, how Constitutional AI enables self-critique and revision, how Red Teaming systematically identifies and addresses safety vulnerabilities, and how multi-objective alignment balances competing objectives like helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty.

However, while understanding alignment techniques is valuable, **true mastery** comes from hands-on implementation. Consider building a chatbot that can safely handle sensitive topics, or implementing a content generation system that maintains honesty while being helpful - these require not just theoretical knowledge but practical skills in implementing RLHF pipelines, reward modeling, and alignment techniques.

This motivates our exploration of **hands-on coding** - the practical implementation of all the RLHF concepts we've learned. We'll put our theoretical knowledge into practice by implementing complete RLHF pipelines, building reward models from preference data, applying policy optimization algorithms, and developing practical applications for chatbot alignment, content generation, and safety evaluation.

The transition from alignment techniques to hands-on coding represents the bridge from understanding to implementation - taking our knowledge of how RLHF and alignment work and turning it into practical tools for building aligned AI systems.

In the next section, we'll implement complete RLHF systems, experiment with different alignment techniques, and develop the practical skills needed for real-world applications in AI alignment and safety.
