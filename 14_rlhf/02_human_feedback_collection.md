# Human Feedback Collection

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of human feedback collection for reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) systems. We'll explore different types of feedback, collection strategies, annotation guidelines, quality control measures, and practical implementation considerations.

## From Theoretical Foundations to Human Feedback Collection

We've now explored **the fundamentals of reinforcement learning for language models** - the mathematical and conceptual foundations that underpin modern RLHF systems. We've seen how traditional RL concepts are adapted for language generation tasks, the unique challenges this domain presents, and the mathematical frameworks that enable learning from human preferences rather than supervised labels.

However, while understanding the theoretical foundations is crucial, **the quality and quantity of human feedback** is what ultimately determines the success of RLHF systems. Consider training a model to be helpful, harmless, and honest - the effectiveness of this training depends entirely on how well we collect and structure human feedback about what constitutes good behavior.

This motivates our exploration of **human feedback collection** - the systematic process of gathering, structuring, and validating human preferences and judgments about model outputs. We'll see how different types of feedback (binary preferences, rankings, ratings, natural language explanations) capture different aspects of human judgment, how to design effective annotation guidelines and quality control measures, and how to mitigate biases and ensure diverse perspectives in the feedback collection process.

The transition from theoretical foundations to human feedback collection represents the bridge from understanding how RLHF works to implementing the data collection pipeline that makes it possible - taking our knowledge of the mathematical framework and applying it to the practical challenge of gathering high-quality human feedback.

In this section, we'll explore human feedback collection, understanding how to design effective data collection strategies that enable successful RLHF training.

## Overview

Human feedback collection is the foundation of RLHF systems. Unlike traditional supervised learning that relies on labeled examples, RLHF learns from human preferences, judgments, and feedback about model outputs. This approach enables training models that align with human values and preferences rather than just mimicking training data.

### Key Principles

**1. Preference-Based Learning**: Learn from relative preferences rather than absolute labels
**2. Subjective Evaluation**: Capture human judgments about quality, safety, and usefulness
**3. Iterative Refinement**: Continuously improve based on feedback
**4. Diverse Perspectives**: Incorporate feedback from various populations and viewpoints

### Mathematical Framework

The goal is to learn a reward function $`R_\phi(x, y)`$ that captures human preferences:

```math
R_\phi(x, y) = f_\phi(\text{encode}(x, y))
```

Where:
- $`x`$: Input prompt/context
- $`y`$: Generated response
- $`f_\phi`$: Neural network with parameters $`\phi`$
- $`\text{encode}`$: Encoder for prompt-response pairs

## Types of Human Feedback

### 1. Binary Preferences

**Definition**: Annotators choose between two responses to the same prompt

**Format**: $(x, y_1, y_2, preference)$ where preference $\in \{1, 2\}$

**Example**:
```
Prompt: "Explain quantum computing in simple terms"
Response A: "Quantum computing uses quantum bits that can be 0, 1, or both at once."
Response B: "Quantum computing is like having a super-fast calculator that uses tiny particles."
Preference: 2 (Response B preferred)
```

**Advantages**:
- Simple and fast annotation
- Clear preference signal
- Easy to implement

**Disadvantages**:
- Limited information (only relative preference)
- May not capture fine-grained differences
- Requires careful response pairing

### 2. Ranking

**Definition**: Annotators order multiple responses by quality

**Format**: $(x, y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_k, ranking)$ where ranking is permutation of $\{1, 2, \ldots, k\}$

**Example**:
```
Prompt: "Write a short story about a robot learning to paint"
Response A: "The robot picked up a brush and painted a beautiful sunset."
Response B: "In a world where robots could feel, one discovered art."
Response C: "The robot's circuits buzzed as it created its first masterpiece."
Ranking: [2, 1, 3] (B > A > C)
```

**Advantages**:
- More informative than binary preferences
- Captures fine-grained differences
- Efficient for multiple comparisons

**Disadvantages**:
- More complex annotation task
- May be inconsistent for similar quality responses
- Requires careful response selection

### 3. Rating

**Definition**: Annotators score responses on Likert scales

**Format**: $(x, y, rating)$ where rating $\in \{1, 2, \ldots, L\}$

**Example**:
```
Prompt: "Summarize the benefits of renewable energy"
Response: "Renewable energy sources like solar and wind provide clean, sustainable power that reduces greenhouse gas emissions and creates jobs."
Rating: 4/5 (Very Good)
```

**Advantages**:
- Absolute quality assessment
- Fine-grained evaluation
- Easy to aggregate

**Disadvantages**:
- Subjective scale interpretation
- May not capture relative preferences well
- Requires calibration across annotators

### 4. Natural Language Feedback

**Definition**: Annotators provide written explanations of their preferences

**Format**: $(x, y_1, y_2, preference, explanation)$

**Example**:
```
Prompt: "Explain machine learning to a 10-year-old"
Response A: "Machine learning is when computers learn from examples, like how you learn to recognize dogs by seeing many pictures of dogs."
Response B: "Machine learning uses algorithms to find patterns in data and make predictions."
Preference: 1 (Response A)
Explanation: "Response A uses a concrete analogy that a child can understand, while Response B uses technical terms that might confuse them."
```

**Advantages**:
- Rich, interpretable feedback
- Captures reasoning behind preferences
- Useful for improving annotation guidelines

**Disadvantages**:
- Time-consuming to collect and process
- Difficult to scale
- Requires qualitative analysis

### Clear Instructions

**Example Guidelines**:
```
EVALUATION CRITERIA

1. HELPFULNESS (1-5 scale)
   - Does the response address the user's question or request?
   - Is the information accurate and relevant?
   - Does it provide the level of detail appropriate for the context?

2. HARMLESSNESS (1-5 scale)
   - Is the response safe and appropriate?
   - Does it avoid harmful, offensive, or dangerous content?
   - Is it suitable for a general audience?

3. HONESTY (1-5 scale)
   - Is the response truthful and accurate?
   - Does it acknowledge limitations when uncertain?
   - Does it avoid making false claims?

4. CLARITY (1-5 scale)
   - Is the response clear and well-structured?
   - Is it easy to understand?
   - Does it use appropriate language for the audience?
```

### Example Demonstrations

**High-Quality Annotation Example**:
```
Prompt: "What are the benefits of exercise?"

Response A: "Exercise helps you stay healthy and strong. It makes your heart work better and can help you live longer. You should try to exercise for at least 30 minutes most days."

Response B: "Exercise is good for you."

Annotation: A > B
Reasoning: Response A provides specific benefits and actionable advice, while Response B is too vague and unhelpful.
```

**Low-Quality Annotation Example**:
```
Prompt: "Explain photosynthesis"

Response A: "Photosynthesis is the process where plants convert sunlight into energy."

Response B: "Plants use sunlight to make food through photosynthesis."

Annotation: A = B
Reasoning: Both responses are equally accurate and helpful.

## From Data Collection to Reward Modeling

We've now explored **human feedback collection** - the systematic process of gathering, structuring, and validating human preferences and judgments about model outputs. We've seen how different types of feedback (binary preferences, rankings, ratings, natural language explanations) capture different aspects of human judgment, how to design effective annotation guidelines and quality control measures, and how to mitigate biases and ensure diverse perspectives in the feedback collection process.

However, while collecting high-quality human feedback is essential, **raw feedback data** is not directly usable for training language models. Consider having thousands of preference judgments - we need a way to convert these relative preferences into a reward function that can guide policy optimization and provide consistent feedback during training.

This motivates our exploration of **reward modeling** - the process of learning a function that maps prompt-response pairs to scalar reward values, capturing human preferences and judgments. We'll see how to design neural network architectures that can learn from preference data, how to formulate training objectives that capture the relative nature of human preferences, how to validate and calibrate reward models, and how to address challenges like reward hacking and distributional shift.

The transition from human feedback collection to reward modeling represents the bridge from raw preference data to learnable reward signals - taking our understanding of how to collect human feedback and applying it to the challenge of building reward functions that can guide effective policy optimization.

In the next section, we'll explore reward modeling, understanding how to convert human preferences into reward functions that enable successful RLHF training.
