## Problem Formulation

### Traditional vs. RL Approaches

**Traditional Supervised Learning:**
- **Input**: Training examples $(x, y^*)$ where $y^*$ is the "correct" response
- **Objective**: Minimize loss between predicted and target responses
- **Limitation**: Requires large amounts of high-quality labeled data

**Reinforcement Learning Approach:**
- **Input**: Human preferences and feedback on model outputs
- **Objective**: Maximize expected reward from human evaluators
- **Advantage**: Can learn from subjective, preference-based feedback

### RL Problem Setup

In RL for language models, we formulate the problem as:

**Environment**: Text generation task (e.g., question answering, summarization, dialogue)
**Agent**: Language model policy $`\pi_\theta`$ with parameters $`\theta`$
**State**: Current conversation context or prompt $`s_t`$
**Action**: Next token to generate $`a_t`$ from vocabulary $`\mathcal{V}`$
**Reward**: Human preference score or learned reward function $`R(s_t, a_t, s_{t+1})`$

### Sequential Decision Making

Language generation is inherently sequential:

```math
P(y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_T | x) = \prod_{t=1}^T P(y_t | x, y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_{t-1})
```

Where:
- $`x`$: Input prompt/context
- $`y_t`$: Token at position $`t`$
- $`T`$: Sequence length

**Key Insight**: Each token decision affects the probability distribution of future tokens, making this a complex sequential decision-making problem.

## Key Challenges

### Language Generation Specifics

#### 1. Sequential Decision Making
Each token affects future decisions, creating a complex dependency structure:

```math
\pi_\theta(a_t | s_t) = P(y_t | x, y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_{t-1})
```

**Challenge**: The action space at each step is the entire vocabulary (typically 50K+ tokens), making exploration difficult.

#### 2. Long Sequences
Reward signals may be sparse and delayed:

- **Sparse Rewards**: Only the final response receives human feedback
- **Delayed Feedback**: Quality of early tokens only becomes apparent later
- **Credit Assignment**: Determining which tokens contributed to good/bad outcomes

**Example**: In a 100-token response, only the final quality is evaluated, making it difficult to attribute credit to individual tokens.

#### 3. High Dimensionality
Large vocabulary and context windows create computational challenges:

- **Vocabulary Size**: 50K+ possible actions at each step
- **Context Length**: 2048+ tokens in modern models
- **State Representation**: High-dimensional embeddings

#### 4. Human Preferences
Subjective and context-dependent rewards:

- **Subjectivity**: Different humans may have different preferences
- **Context Dependence**: Same response may be good in one context, bad in another
- **Temporal Drift**: Preferences may change over time

### Reward Function Challenges

#### Reward Hacking
Models may optimize for proxy objectives rather than true human preferences:

```math
R_{\text{proxy}}(s, a) \neq R_{\text{true}}(s, a)
```

**Examples**:
- Optimizing for length rather than quality
- Using repetitive patterns to increase reward
- Exploiting reward model weaknesses

#### Reward Model Overfitting
The reward model may not generalize to new scenarios:

```math
\mathbb{E}_{(s,a) \sim \mathcal{D}_{\text{train}}} [R_\phi(s,a)] \gg \mathbb{E}_{(s,a) \sim \mathcal{D}_{\text{test}}} [R_\phi(s,a)]
```

## RL Framework for LLMs

### Markov Decision Process (MDP) Formulation

**State Space**: $`\mathcal{S}`$ - All possible conversation contexts
- **Representation**: Token embeddings or hidden states
- **Dimensionality**: High-dimensional continuous space
- **Structure**: Sequential, with temporal dependencies

**Action Space**: $`\mathcal{A}`$ - Vocabulary tokens
- **Size**: 50K+ discrete actions
- **Structure**: Hierarchical (subword tokens)
- **Constraints**: Valid token sequences

**Transition Function**: $`P(s'|s,a)`$ - Language model dynamics
```math
P(s_{t+1} | s_t, a_t) = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } s_{t+1} = \text{concat}(s_t, a_t) \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
```

**Reward Function**: $`R(s,a,s')`$ - Human preference or learned reward
```math
R(s_t, a_t, s_{t+1}) = \begin{cases}
R_{\text{final}}(s_T) & \text{if } t = T \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
```

**Policy**: $`\pi_\theta(a|s)`$ - Language model parameters
```math
\pi_\theta(a_t | s_t) = \text{softmax}(f_\theta(s_t))
```

### Value Functions

#### State Value Function
Expected return from state $`s`$:

```math
V^\pi(s) = \mathbb{E}_{\pi} \left[ \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \gamma^t R_t | s_0 = s \right]
```

#### Action-Value Function
Expected return from taking action $`a`$ in state $`s`$:

```math
Q^\pi(s, a) = \mathbb{E}_{\pi} \left[ \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \gamma^t R_t | s_0 = s, a_0 = a \right]
```

#### Advantage Function
Relative value of actions:

```math
A^\pi(s, a) = Q^\pi(s, a) - V^\pi(s)
```

## Mathematical Foundations

### Policy Gradient Theorem

For language models, the policy gradient is:

```math
\nabla_\theta J(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{s \sim \rho_\pi, a \sim \pi_\theta} [R(s,a) \nabla_\theta \log \pi_\theta(a|s)]
```

Where:
- $`\rho_\pi`$: State distribution under policy $`\pi`$
- $`R(s,a)`$: Reward for taking action $`a`$ in state $`s`$

### REINFORCE Algorithm

**Algorithm Steps**:
1. Sample trajectory $`\tau = (s_0, a_0, r_0, s_1, a_1, r_1, \ldots)`$
2. Compute returns $`R_t = \sum_{k=t}^T \gamma^{k-t} r_k`$
3. Update policy: $`\theta \leftarrow \theta + \alpha \sum_t R_t \nabla_\theta \log \pi_\theta(a_t|s_t)`$

**Implementation:** See `policy_optimization.py` for REINFORCE implementation:
- `REINFORCETrainer` - Complete REINFORCE trainer for language models
- `reinforce_loss()` - REINFORCE loss computation
- `train_step()` - Training step implementation

### Actor-Critic Methods

**Actor-Critic Architecture**:
- **Actor**: Policy network $`\pi_\theta(a|s)`$
- **Critic**: Value network $`V_\phi(s)`$

**Advantage Estimation**:
```math
A_t = R_t + \gamma V_\phi(s_{t+1}) - V_\phi(s_t)
```

**Policy Update**:
```math
\nabla_\theta J(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_t [A_t \nabla_\theta \log \pi_\theta(a_t|s_t)]
```

### Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)

**PPO-Clip Objective**:
```math
L(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_t \left[\min\left(r_t(\theta) A_t, \text{clip}(r_t(\theta), 1-\epsilon, 1+\epsilon) A_t\right)\right]
```

Where:
- $`r_t(\theta) = \frac{\pi_\theta(a_t|s_t)}{\pi_{\theta_{old}}(a_t|s_t)}`$: Probability ratio
- $`A_t`$: Advantage estimate
- $`\epsilon`$: Clipping parameter (typically 0.2)

**KL Penalty Version**:
```math
L(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_t [r_t(\theta) A_t - \beta \text{KL}(\pi_{\theta_{old}} \| \pi_\theta)]
```

**Implementation:** See `policy_optimization.py` for PPO implementation:

## Practical Considerations

### Baseline Methods

**Importance of Baselines**:
- **Variance Reduction**: Baselines reduce gradient variance
- **Stable Training**: Prevents large policy updates
- **Faster Convergence**: More efficient learning

**Common Baselines**:
- **Value Function**: $`V_\phi(s_t)`$ as baseline
- **Moving Average**: Exponential moving average of returns
- **Constant Baseline**: Mean reward across batch

### Entropy Regularization

**Purpose**: Encourage exploration and prevent premature convergence

```math
L(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_t [r_t(\theta) A_t] - \alpha \mathbb{E}_t [H(\pi_\theta(\cdot|s_t))]
```

Where:
- $`H(\pi_\theta(\cdot|s_t))`$: Entropy of policy distribution
- $`\alpha`$: Entropy coefficient

### KL Divergence Control

**Purpose**: Prevent policy from deviating too far from reference model

```math
L(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_t [r_t(\theta) A_t] - \beta \text{KL}(\pi_{\text{ref}} \| \pi_\theta)
```

**Benefits**:
- **Stability**: Prevents catastrophic forgetting
- **Safety**: Maintains reasonable behavior
- **Convergence**: More stable training dynamics

### Reward Scaling

**Challenge**: Reward scales may vary significantly

**Solutions**:
- **Normalization**: Standardize rewards to zero mean, unit variance
- **Clipping**: Clip rewards to reasonable range
- **Log Scaling**: Apply log transformation to rewards

## From Theoretical Foundations to Human Feedback Collection

We've now explored **the fundamentals of reinforcement learning for language models** - the mathematical and conceptual foundations that underpin modern RLHF systems. We've seen how traditional RL concepts are adapted for language generation tasks, the unique challenges this domain presents, and the mathematical frameworks that enable learning from human preferences rather than supervised labels.

However, while understanding the theoretical foundations is crucial, **the quality and quantity of human feedback** is what ultimately determines the success of RLHF systems. Consider training a model to be helpful, harmless, and honest - the effectiveness of this training depends entirely on how well we collect and structure human feedback about what constitutes good behavior.

This motivates our exploration of **human feedback collection** - the systematic process of gathering, structuring, and validating human preferences and judgments about model outputs. We'll see how different types of feedback (binary preferences, rankings, ratings, natural language explanations) capture different aspects of human judgment, how to design effective annotation guidelines and quality control measures, and how to mitigate biases and ensure diverse perspectives in the feedback collection process.

The transition from theoretical foundations to human feedback collection represents the bridge from understanding how RLHF works to implementing the data collection pipeline that makes it possible - taking our knowledge of the mathematical framework and applying it to the practical challenge of gathering high-quality human feedback.

In the next section, we'll explore human feedback collection, understanding how to design effective data collection strategies that enable successful RLHF training.
