# Best Arm Identification

## Introduction

Best Arm Identification (BAI) represents a fundamental shift in the multi-armed bandit paradigm from cumulative reward maximization to pure exploration. Unlike traditional bandit algorithms that balance exploration and exploitation, BAI algorithms focus exclusively on identifying the best arm with high confidence, regardless of the cumulative reward achieved during the learning process.

### The Big Picture: What is Best Arm Identification?

**The BAI Problem:**
Imagine you're a scientist testing 10 different drugs to find the most effective one. You have a limited budget and time, and you need to be confident about your final recommendation. You don't care about how well the drugs perform during testing - you only care about identifying the best one correctly. This is the best arm identification problem - pure exploration to find the best option.

**The Intuitive Analogy:**
Think of BAI like a detective trying to identify the best suspect from a lineup. The detective doesn't care about getting rewards during the investigation - they only care about correctly identifying the guilty party at the end. They'll use all their resources to gather enough evidence to be confident in their final decision.

**Why BAI Matters:**
- **Accuracy over performance**: Focus on correct identification, not immediate rewards
- **Resource efficiency**: Use limited resources to maximize confidence
- **Real-world relevance**: Many problems prioritize identification over optimization
- **Theoretical foundations**: Provides insights into pure exploration

### The Key Insight

**From Optimization to Identification:**
- **Traditional bandits**: "How can I maximize my total rewards?"
- **Best arm identification**: "How can I be most confident about which arm is best?"

**The Paradigm Shift:**
- **No exploitation needed**: We don't need to use the best arm during learning
- **Pure exploration**: Focus entirely on gathering information
- **Confidence-driven**: Stop when we're confident enough

## From Cumulative Reward to Pure Exploration

We've now explored **contextual bandits** - extending the bandit framework to handle dynamic contexts where the optimal action depends on the current state. We've seen how contextual UCB and contextual Thompson sampling adapt to changing environments, how personalization enables tailored decisions, and how these methods handle the complexity of real-world applications.

However, while traditional bandit algorithms focus on maximizing cumulative reward through exploration-exploitation balance, **many real-world scenarios** prioritize accurate identification over immediate performance. Consider a clinical trial where the goal is to identify the most effective treatment, or an A/B test where the objective is to determine the best website design - in these cases, we care more about making the right final decision than about maximizing rewards during the learning process.

This motivates our exploration of **best arm identification (BAI)** - a fundamental shift in the bandit paradigm from cumulative reward maximization to pure exploration. We'll see how BAI algorithms focus exclusively on identifying the best arm with high confidence, how they use different stopping criteria and sampling strategies, and how these methods enable efficient identification in scenarios where accuracy is more important than immediate performance.

The transition from contextual bandits to best arm identification represents the bridge from adaptive learning to pure exploration - taking our understanding of bandit algorithms and applying it to scenarios where the goal is identification rather than cumulative reward maximization.

In this section, we'll explore best arm identification, understanding how to design algorithms for pure exploration problems.

### Understanding the Motivation

**The Traditional Bandit Limitation:**
Traditional bandits try to maximize cumulative reward, but many real-world problems care more about making the right final decision.

**The BAI Solution:**
Focus entirely on identifying the best arm with high confidence, regardless of rewards during learning.

**The Real-World Advantage:**
- **Clinical trials**: Identify best treatment, not maximize short-term outcomes
- **A/B testing**: Determine best design, not maximize immediate conversions
- **Drug discovery**: Find most promising candidate, not maximize early results
- **Product development**: Select best variant, not maximize development rewards

### Key Differences from Traditional Bandits

**Traditional Bandits (Regret Minimization):**
- Goal: Maximize cumulative reward $`\sum_{t=1}^T r_t`$
- Metric: Cumulative regret $`R(T) = \sum_{t=1}^T (\mu^* - \mu_{a_t})`$
- Trade-off: Exploration vs. exploitation
- **Intuitive**: Like trying to win as much money as possible while learning

**Best Arm Identification (Pure Exploration):**
- Goal: Identify best arm with high confidence
- Metric: Success probability $`P(\hat{i}^* = i^*)`$
- Focus: Pure exploration, no exploitation needed
- **Intuitive**: Like trying to be most confident about which restaurant is best

## Problem Formulation

### Understanding the Problem Setup

**The Basic Scenario:**
You have K arms with unknown reward distributions and a limited budget (time, money, samples). Your goal is to identify the arm with the highest mean reward with high confidence.

**Key Questions:**
- How do you allocate your limited budget across arms?
- When do you stop and make your final decision?
- How do you measure confidence in your identification?

### Mathematical Setup

In the best arm identification problem, we have:

- **$`K`$ arms** with unknown reward distributions
- **Fixed budget** of $`T`$ total pulls
- **Goal**: Identify arm with highest mean reward $`i^* = \arg\max_i \mu_i`$
- **Success criterion**: $`P(\hat{i}^* = i^*) \geq 1-\delta`$ where $`\delta`$ is the failure probability

**Intuitive Understanding:**
This says: "You have K options, a limited budget, and you want to identify the best option with high confidence (low failure probability)."

**The Learning Process:**
1. **Allocate budget**: Decide how to spend your limited pulls
2. **Gather information**: Pull arms to learn their true means
3. **Update confidence**: Track how confident you are about each arm
4. **Stop and decide**: Make final decision when confident enough

### Key Definitions

**Gaps:**
- $`\Delta_i = \mu_{i^*} - \mu_i`$: Gap between optimal arm and arm $`i`$
- $`\Delta_{\min} = \min_{i \neq i^*} \Delta_i`$: Minimum gap
- $`\Delta_{\max} = \max_{i \neq i^*} \Delta_i`$: Maximum gap

**Intuitive Understanding:**
- **Gaps**: How much worse each arm is compared to the best
- **Minimum gap**: The hardest arm to distinguish from the best
- **Maximum gap**: The easiest arm to distinguish from the best

**Sample Complexity:**
- **Gap-dependent**: $`O(\sum_{i \neq i^*} \frac{1}{\Delta_i^2} \log \frac{1}{\delta})`$
- **Gap-independent**: $`O(K \log \frac{1}{\delta})`$

**Intuitive Understanding:**
- **Gap-dependent**: Harder problems (smaller gaps) need more samples
- **Gap-independent**: Some algorithms work regardless of gap size

**Confidence Intervals:**
- $`\text{CI}_i(t) = [\hat{\mu}_i(t) \pm \beta_i(t)]`$: Confidence interval for arm $`i`$ at time $`t`$
- $`\beta_i(t)`$: Confidence radius (depends on algorithm)

**Intuitive Understanding:**
Confidence intervals tell us "we're confident the true mean is within this range." The radius depends on how many times we've pulled the arm.

### Problem Variants

**Fixed Budget:**
- Total number of pulls $`T`$ is fixed
- Goal: Maximize success probability
- **Intuitive**: Like having a fixed amount of money to spend on testing

**Fixed Confidence:**
- Target success probability $`1-\delta`$ is fixed
- Goal: Minimize expected number of pulls
- **Intuitive**: Like needing to be 95% confident, regardless of cost

**Fixed Budget and Confidence:**
- Both $`T`$ and $`\delta`$ are fixed
- Goal: Achieve success probability $`\geq 1-\delta`$ within $`T`$ pulls
- **Intuitive**: Like having both a budget and a confidence requirement

## Fundamental Algorithms

### Understanding Algorithm Design

**The Algorithm Challenge:**
How do you design a strategy that efficiently identifies the best arm with high confidence?

**Key Principles:**
- **Efficient allocation**: Spend more time on arms that are harder to distinguish
- **Confidence tracking**: Maintain confidence intervals for all arms
- **Stopping criteria**: Stop when confident enough to make decision
- **Adaptive sampling**: Focus on arms with highest uncertainty

### 1. Successive Elimination

Successive Elimination is a simple and intuitive algorithm that eliminates arms progressively based on empirical comparisons.

**Intuitive Understanding:**
Successive Elimination is like a tournament where you eliminate the worst players in each round. You start with all arms, pull each one a few times, eliminate the worst one, and repeat until only the best arm remains.

**Algorithm:**
1. **Initialization**: Pull each arm $`n_0`$ times
2. **Elimination**: Eliminate arms with low empirical means
3. **Iteration**: Continue until one arm remains

**The Learning Process:**
1. **Start**: Pull each arm a few times to get initial estimates
2. **Compare**: Compare empirical means of all arms
3. **Eliminate**: Remove the arm with lowest empirical mean
4. **Continue**: Pull remaining arms more times and repeat
5. **Finish**: Return the last remaining arm

**Why This Works:**
- **Progressive focus**: Concentrate on promising arms
- **Simple logic**: Easy to understand and implement
- **Efficient**: Don't waste time on clearly bad arms
- **Theoretical guarantees**: Proven to work with high probability

**Implementation:**
See [`code/successive_elimination.py`](code/successive_elimination.py) for the complete implementation.

```python
# Key implementation details:
class SuccessiveElimination:
    # Initialize statistics and active arms set
    # Pull arms until n0 times, then eliminate worst arm
    # Continue until only one arm remains
```

**Theoretical Guarantees:**
- **Sample Complexity**: $`O(\sum_{i \neq i^*} \frac{1}{\Delta_i^2} \log \frac{K}{\delta})`$
- **Success Probability**: $`P(\hat{i}^* = i^*) \geq 1-\delta`$

**When to Use:**
- **Simple problems**: When you want an easy-to-understand algorithm
- **Educational purposes**: To understand BAI concepts
- **Baseline comparison**: As a benchmark for more sophisticated algorithms

### 2. Racing Algorithms

Racing algorithms maintain confidence intervals for all arms and stop when one arm is clearly the best.

**Intuitive Understanding:**
Racing algorithms are like a race where you track each runner's position with uncertainty. You stop the race when one runner is clearly ahead of all others (their confidence intervals don't overlap).

**Algorithm:**
1. **Initialization**: Pull each arm $`n_0`$ times
2. **Confidence Intervals**: Maintain confidence intervals for all arms
3. **Stopping Criterion**: Stop when one arm's lower bound exceeds all others' upper bounds
4. **Adaptive Allocation**: Pull arms with highest uncertainty

**The Learning Process:**
1. **Initialize**: Pull each arm a few times
2. **Track confidence**: Maintain confidence intervals for all arms
3. **Check separation**: See if any arm is clearly best
4. **Pull uncertain**: If not separated, pull arms with highest uncertainty
5. **Stop**: Return arm when confidence intervals separate

**Why This Works:**
- **Adaptive allocation**: Focus on arms that need more information
- **Natural stopping**: Stop as soon as confident enough
- **Efficient**: Don't pull arms that are clearly not the best
- **Theoretical guarantees**: Optimal sample complexity

**Implementation:**
See [`code/racing_algorithm.py`](code/racing_algorithm.py) for the complete implementation.

```python
# Key implementation details:
class RacingAlgorithm:
    # Maintain confidence intervals for all arms
    # Pull arms with highest uncertainty
    # Stop when one arm's lower bound exceeds all others' upper bounds
```

### 3. LUCB (Lower-Upper Confidence Bound)

LUCB is a sophisticated algorithm that pulls the arm with highest upper bound and the arm with highest lower bound among the remaining arms.

**Intuitive Understanding:**
LUCB is like a smart detective who focuses on the most promising suspect (highest upper bound) and the most challenging competitor (highest lower bound). By comparing these two, the detective can efficiently determine which is truly the best.

**Algorithm:**
1. **Initialization**: Pull each arm $`n_0`$ times
2. **Arm Selection**: Pull arms with highest upper bound and highest lower bound
3. **Stopping Criterion**: Stop when intervals separate

**The Learning Process:**
1. **Initialize**: Pull each arm a few times
2. **Identify candidates**: Find arm with highest upper bound and arm with highest lower bound
3. **Pull both**: Pull both candidate arms to reduce uncertainty
4. **Check separation**: See if confidence intervals separate
5. **Continue**: Repeat until confident enough

**Why This Works:**
- **Optimal strategy**: Theoretically optimal sample complexity
- **Efficient comparison**: Focus on the most relevant comparison
- **Adaptive allocation**: Automatically adapts to problem difficulty
- **Strong guarantees**: Best known theoretical bounds

**Implementation:**
See [`code/lucb.py`](code/lucb.py) for the complete implementation.

```python
# Key implementation details:
class LUCB:
    # Pull arm with highest upper bound and arm with highest lower bound
    # Use LUCB-specific confidence intervals
    # Stop when intervals separate
```

### 4. Sequential Halving

Sequential Halving is an efficient algorithm that eliminates half of the remaining arms in each round.

**Intuitive Understanding:**
Sequential Halving is like a tournament where you eliminate half the players in each round. You start with all arms, pull each one equally, eliminate the bottom half, and repeat until only the best arm remains.

**Algorithm:**
1. **Initialization**: Start with all arms
2. **Rounds**: In each round, pull remaining arms equally
3. **Elimination**: Eliminate bottom half of arms based on empirical means
4. **Termination**: Continue until one arm remains

**The Learning Process:**
1. **Start**: Begin with all K arms
2. **Pull equally**: Pull each remaining arm the same number of times
3. **Eliminate half**: Remove the bottom half based on empirical means
4. **Repeat**: Continue until only one arm remains
5. **Return**: Return the last remaining arm

**Why This Works:**
- **Simple structure**: Easy to understand and implement
- **Efficient**: Logarithmic number of rounds
- **Fair allocation**: Each arm gets equal attention
- **Scalable**: Works well for large numbers of arms

**Implementation:**
See [`code/sequential_halving.py`](code/sequential_halving.py) for the complete implementation.

```python
# Key implementation details:
class SequentialHalving:
    # Eliminate half of remaining arms in each round
    # Pull arms equally within each round
    # Continue until one arm remains
```

## Theoretical Analysis

### Understanding Regret Analysis

**The Analysis Challenge:**
How do we mathematically analyze how well BAI algorithms perform? What guarantees can we provide?

**Key Questions:**
- How many samples do we need to identify the best arm?
- How does sample complexity depend on problem difficulty?
- What are the fundamental limits of any algorithm?

### Sample Complexity Bounds

**Gap-dependent Bounds:**
For algorithms with gap-dependent sample complexity:

```math
\mathbb{E}[N] \leq O\left(\sum_{i \neq i^*} \frac{1}{\Delta_i^2} \log \frac{1}{\delta}\right)
```

**Intuitive Understanding:**
This bound says: "The expected number of samples needed is proportional to the sum of inverse squared gaps, times a logarithmic factor."

**Breaking Down the Bound:**
- **$`\frac{1}{\Delta_i^2}`$**: Harder arms (smaller gaps) need more samples
- **$`\log \frac{1}{\delta}`$**: Higher confidence (lower δ) needs more samples
- **Sum over arms**: Total samples across all suboptimal arms

**Gap-independent Bounds:**
For algorithms with gap-independent sample complexity:

```math
\mathbb{E}[N] \leq O\left(K \log \frac{1}{\delta}\right)
```

**Intuitive Understanding:**
Some algorithms work regardless of how hard the problem is - they just need to see each arm enough times.

**Lower Bounds:**
For any BAI algorithm:

```math
\mathbb{E}[N] \geq \Omega\left(\sum_{i \neq i^*} \frac{1}{\Delta_i^2} \log \frac{1}{\delta}\right)
```

**Intuitive Understanding:**
No algorithm can do better than this - it's a fundamental limit of the problem.

### Confidence Interval Analysis

**Hoeffding-based Intervals:**
For bounded rewards $`r_i \in [0, 1]`$:

```math
P(|\hat{\mu}_i - \mu_i| \geq \epsilon) \leq 2\exp(-2n_i \epsilon^2)
```

**Intuitive Understanding:**
This says: "The probability that our estimate is far from the true mean decreases exponentially with the number of samples."

**Chernoff-based Intervals:**
For Bernoulli rewards:

```math
P(|\hat{\mu}_i - \mu_i| \geq \epsilon) \leq 2\exp(-n_i \text{KL}(\mu_i + \epsilon \| \mu_i))
```

**Intuitive Understanding:**
For binary rewards, we can get tighter bounds using KL divergence.

**Union Bound:**
For multiple arms and time steps:

```math
P(\exists i, t : |\hat{\mu}_i(t) - \mu_i| \geq \beta_i(t)) \leq \delta
```

**Intuitive Understanding:**
This ensures that all our confidence intervals are correct with high probability.

- **Cons**: Complex implementation, may be conservative
- **Sample Complexity**: $`O(\sum_{i \neq i^*} \frac{1}{\Delta_i^2} \log \frac{1}{\delta})`$
- **When to use**: When you need optimal performance

**Sequential Halving:**
- **Pros**: Simple, efficient for large action spaces
- **Cons**: Fixed budget requirement, may not be optimal
- **Sample Complexity**: $`O(K \log \frac{1}{\delta})`$
- **When to use**: Large action spaces, fixed budget scenarios

## Practical Considerations

### Understanding Practical Challenges

**The Implementation Challenge:**
How do you implement BAI algorithms in practice? What issues arise in real-world applications?

**Key Considerations:**
- **Parameter tuning**: How to set confidence levels and initial sample sizes
- **Stopping criteria**: When to stop and make final decision
- **Numerical stability**: Avoiding computational issues
- **Real-world constraints**: Handling practical limitations

### Parameter Tuning

**Confidence Level ($`\delta`$):**
- **Typical values**: $`\delta = 0.1, 0.05, 0.01`$
- **Trade-off**: Lower $`\delta`$ requires more samples but higher confidence
- **Application-specific**: Choose based on cost of incorrect identification

**Intuitive Understanding:**
- **δ = 0.1**: 90% confident, faster but less reliable
- **δ = 0.05**: 95% confident, balanced choice
- **δ = 0.01**: 99% confident, slower but very reliable

**Initial Sample Size ($`n_0`$):**
- **Theoretical**: $`n_0 = O(\log \frac{K}{\delta})`$
- **Practical**: $`n_0 = 10-50`$ often works well
- **Adaptive**: Can be adjusted based on observed gaps

**Intuitive Understanding:**
- **Too small n0**: May eliminate good arms too early
- **Too large n0**: Waste samples on clearly bad arms
- **Just right**: Balance between efficiency and reliability

### Stopping Criteria

**Fixed Budget:**
- Stop when $`T`$ pulls are exhausted
- Return best arm based on empirical means
- **Intuitive**: Like running out of money for testing

**Fixed Confidence:**
- Stop when confidence intervals separate
- Return arm with highest lower bound
- **Intuitive**: Like stopping when you're confident enough

**Adaptive Stopping:**
- Stop when success probability exceeds threshold
- Requires online estimation of success probability
- **Intuitive**: Like stopping when you think you've found the answer

### Numerical Stability

**Confidence Interval Calculation:**
See [`code/bai_utils.py`](code/bai_utils.py) for the complete implementation.

```python
# Key functionality:
def stable_confidence_radius(pulls, delta, method='hoeffding'):
    # Calculate stable confidence radius using Hoeffding or Chernoff bounds

def stable_mean_update(old_mean, old_count, new_value):
    # Stable incremental mean update
```

**Intuitive Understanding:**
Numerical stability ensures our calculations don't break down due to floating-point errors or extreme values.

- **Preference learning**: Learn user preferences over objectives

### Best Arm Identification with Constraints

**Resource Constraints:**
- **Budget constraints**: Limited total cost

**Algorithms:**
- **Constrained BAI**: Add constraint handling to BAI algorithms
- **Safe exploration**: Ensure constraints are satisfied during identification

## From Pure Exploration to Real-World Applications

We've now explored **Best Arm Identification (BAI)** - a fundamental shift in the multi-armed bandit paradigm from cumulative reward maximization to pure exploration. We've seen how algorithms like Successive Elimination, Racing, LUCB, and Sequential Halving focus exclusively on identifying the best arm with high confidence, regardless of the cumulative reward achieved during the learning process.

However, while understanding BAI algorithms is valuable, **the true impact** of multi-armed bandits lies in their real-world applications. Consider the algorithms we've learned - from classical bandits to linear and contextual bandits, and now best arm identification - these theoretical frameworks become powerful when applied to solve actual problems in advertising, healthcare, e-commerce, and beyond.

This motivates our exploration of **applications and use cases** - the practical implementation of bandit algorithms across diverse domains. We'll see how bandits optimize ad selection and bidding in online advertising, how they enable personalized recommendations in e-commerce and content platforms, how they improve clinical trials and drug discovery in healthcare, how they optimize pricing strategies in dynamic markets, and how they enhance A/B testing and algorithm selection processes.

The transition from best arm identification to applications represents the bridge from pure exploration to practical impact - taking our understanding of how to identify optimal actions and applying it to real-world scenarios where intelligent decision-making under uncertainty provides significant value.

In the next section, we'll explore applications and use cases, understanding how bandit algorithms solve real-world problems and create value across diverse domains.

## Complete Example Usage

- Environment setup and algorithm comparison
- Performance analysis and ranking
